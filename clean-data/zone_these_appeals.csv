Up until a few years ago, the building had a rear, open deck (approximately 15 ft x 10 ft) which provided both units access to outdoor open space and was the rear means of egress from the first floor of their units out to the rear yard. The rear deck when built met the then applicable rear yard set back requirements for the district. Due to shoddy construction and resulting extensive wood rot, the rear deck failed and had to be demolished. Since that time, petitioners have lacked a rear means of egress from their first floor, and have had to appeal to their insurance company to acknowledge that the rear basement entry doors were sufficient for egress purposes. The petitioners have also experienced severe flooding of their basements due to the fact that there is no longer any shelter over the rear stairs which lead from the yard below grade to the basement entryway (approximately 4-5 feet below grade). Petitioners proposal is to rebuild, creating an enclosed porch, two small decks (one for each unit owner), and a rear egress stair from the porch down to the rear yard. An enclosed porch will provide the petitioners some much needed privacy.  The property abuts a parking lot to a City of Cambridge park and pool which is frequented by people at all hours, who are oftentimes quite noisy, smoke cigarettes, drink and throw trash over the fence into the petitioners' yard. A literal enforcement of this Ordinance would result in a denial of the petitioners' application which would in turn result in a substantial hardship. Petitioners would be unable to construct an enclosed porch in order to serve their reasonable needs for privacy, usable recreational space, a rear egress from the main living floor of their homes, and a shelter over the rear basement entryway.","The peitioners' addition will not be detrimental to the public good, as it will result in a minimal addition at the rear of the property which will hardly be seen by neighboring homeowners.  The addition will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it will affect the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to immediate abuttors. And the users of the City of Cambridge park at the rear will enjoy the view of the tastefully designed porch addition.","The relief requested is minimal and will be in keeping with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance to protect the residential use of properties in the District. Petitioners ask that you allow for a modest increase in the gross floor area (of 242 sf.: an 182 sf enclosed porch, and a 60 sf lower level enclosed basement entryway), which results in an overall FAR of 0.50 which, if sited on a 5,000 sf lot, would be allowable as of right. The petitioners also ask that you allow for the addition and the common rear stairs to lie within the rear yard setback, where the rear yard is currently unusable due to the nuisance caused by users of the abutting City of Cambridge park at the rear. Moreover, the overall variance is minimal for the relief sought.","The hardship is owing in part to the size and shape of the lot which is oversized (6,000 sf) thus triggering a larger than usual rear yard setback of 30 feet and a lower than usual floor area ratio maximum (of between 0.35 to 0.50).  The hardship is also owing to the location of the structure on the lot; the house is set almost squarely on the lot: 33 feet from the front lot line and 37.9 feet from the rear lot line, leaving the petitioners with a relatively oversized front yard, and undersized rear yard. Additionally, the fact that the property abuts the City of Cambridge park and the parking lot of the park, and the nuisance caused by the users of the park results in a further unique hardship.  Finally, the faulty construction design of the rear basement entryway, and resulting likelihood of basement flooding, is a further source of financial and emotional hardship for the petitioners.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boston","MA","03/27/2015"

Part of a cul-de-sac of modest similarly scaled two story structures, preservation of the consistency of the historic streetscape dictates that any new construction or additions be kept to the rear of the lot, and further that they not be accomplished through the addition of a further story which would alter the scale of the street.  In order to undertake the rehabilitation of the structure and to construct needed additions that conform to the gross floor area requirements of the district, zoning relief is required for setbacks. Further the addition of off street parking that will rectify the current non-compliance requires dimensional relief.

The plans involve the following, each requiring a variance from Article 5.000 dimensional standards: (A) moving the 2nd apartment’s front entry door to the garden level to be accessed via stairs down to a sunken patio and entryway, and constructing a window well for the garden level apartment bedroom (for light and emergency egress) within the front yard setback; (B) creating a rear egress hallway for the garden level apartment and other minor alterations to porch overhangs result in an increase of 38 square feet of Gross Floor Area; and(C) relocating the parking area, which is currently undersized and located in the front yard setback, to a conforming-sized parking area in an improved location but still located within the front yard setback. The pre-existing, non-conforming parking space (shown as “patio/parking” on the survey plan) has been used by the prior owners for the past 85 years. (See Affidavit of Patricia A. DeCaprio, the previous owner, whose family had owned the Property for approximately 85 years and openly parked in this area throughout this time).  The parking space is undersized, even for a small compact vehicle, resulting in parked cars partially intruding onto the private way.  The Petitioner seeks to relocate the parking space, creating a compliant-sized parking space with permeable materials, resulting in a parking area that is more compliant although still located within front yard setback.  In order to minimize impacts to abutters and create more privacy in their backyard, the Petitioners will install a fence with sliding gate for access to the relocated parking space. To locate the parking further back (as the ordinance would require) would result in even less usable yard area, with little benefit to the neighbors along Athens Terrace. An additional aspect of the work -- constructing stairs and a head house to access new mechanical systems on the roof and a 10 x 20 ft roof deck (not counted towards Gross Floor Area) – should not require a variance because: 1) the stair head house is exempt from calculations of height under Section 5.23 as a “necessary feature appurtenant to buildings which are usually carried above roofs and are not used for human occupancy”, or 2) even if not exempt under Section 5.23, the height of the building with head house will be 35 ft, complying with height requirement for the district.  Note: area within the head house is not included in Gross Floor Area (see definition of “Gross Floor Area shall not include” subsection 7.   HARDSHIP:A literal enforcement of the ordinance impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from renovating this two-family home which is in substantial need of repair, and create a comfortable home for their family while maintaining a 2nd rental apartment on the garden level.  The Petitioner has explored numerous alternatives each of which result in various dimensional non-conformities of varying degrees.  The plans presented to the BZA with this application represent the Petitioner’s best effort to make changes necessary to achieve their desired continued use of this two-family home with minimal zoning relief requested.  The relocation of the front entry and rear egress to the 2nd apartment each result in changes that require zoning relief.  The front entry changes necessitate retaining walls and window wells that Inspectional Services has indicated are deemed to be structures which will be located within the front yard setback, thus requiring a variance.  The new rear egress from the 2nd apartment  requires the relocation of the parking to a location further from the house.  The stair head house on the roof will make access to roof mechanical systems safer and easier, and will allow access to an otherwise zoning compliant roof deck (which will make up for the loss of usable open space in the yard).","Variance relief from Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good.  The renovations to the building will be a vast improvement to the current dilapidated condition, modifications to the exterior will not result in any additions or expansion of the exterior footprint of the building.  Window wells and sunken entrance to the garden level apartment on Athens St. will be below grade and obscured from the road by landscaping, an improvement over the current conditions. The increased GFA will not be seen or have any impact on density or uses within the building.  Finally, the relocated parking area will also be an improvement for the Petitioner and future residents as well as abutters along Athens Terrace, a private way. The current small parking space situation results in owners with a larger vehicle unable to use the parking space, and thus parking along Athens Terrace (a one way, private way, that the City Fire Dept. prohibits parking on the opposite side).  By relocating and increasing the size of the parking space on the Property, and with the new entry location, abutters on Athens Terrace may have an additional space to park along the private way. There will be no adverse impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In fact, the changes to parking will improve these conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioner is able to park on their Property (and not on the private way).  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to proceed with plans to rehabilitate this Property and allow for them to make this their home, while preserving a much-needed rental apartment for the neighborhood.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.•	Preserve much-needed rental housing in an area of Cambridge in great need of such housing.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the structure’s interior configuration of the apartments, aged condition and need for significant rehabilitation, the siting of the structure on this undersized, narrow lot which is located on a corner of a private way with difficult access in for parking.  These unique circumstances collectively result in the Petitioner requiring zoning relief in order to make even modest improvements to the Property.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boston","MA","05/31/2019"

The petitioner anticipates living in the house for the rest of her life and because of this would need to have a bath on the first floor to make the house accessible. Because the current status of the house does not allow any additions this would mean the house would not be accessible if needed, creating an undue hardship and forcing her to move.

These window and door alterations require a special permit.  The renovations that result in these window and door modifications are otherwise conforming alterations to this pre-existing, nonconforming, single-family home, including the following: a) construction of a second-floor rear dormer (conforming pursuant to Article 8, Section 8.22.1 H(1)), b) reconfiguring kitchen and dining area, and c) relocating an egress door – demolishing the right-side front porch entry and relocating the egress to the right side of the house.  Due to the fact that this home is located at the far rear portion of this deep and narrow lot in violation of current setback requirements of the Ordinance, any window or door changes on the rear or side of the house require special permit relief.  Specific changes requiring relief includes the following:At the rear of the house: relocating three windows on the first floor rear wall (shifting locations of existing windows by inches); relocating and enlarging three windows on the second floor rear wall (to allow light and air to second floor stairway/hallway and bathroom); and adding a small window on the rear first floor (kitchen) and a new window on the second floor (son’s bedroom).At the right side of the house: enlarging windows and constructing egress doors to the side patio. Construction will otherwise comply with other dimensional requirements of the Ordinance.","The proposed construction will not result in additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character.  The window and door modifications will be consistent with the style of other residential structures in the neighborhood. These changes will allow for much needed improvements within this single-family home, and will be very much in keeping with the historic character of the home and the residential neighborhood.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed renovations of the house.  This will continue to be used as a single-family residential home, and modifications will not result in adverse impacts on the neighboring residential uses.  Relocated, enlarged and new windows and doors will have minimal impacts on neighbors due to their location and the limited views from the neighboring properties at the rear and right side of the house.  It should be noted that three of the windows at the new second floor dormer level will be windows from a stairwell/hallway (to provide light and air to second floor of the home) and a bathroom; and the fourth window at that level will replace the smaller window in the bedroom.  Relocated windows will be shifted by inches, resulting in minor changes not impacting the neighbors in terms of light or privacy. The relocated right side egress doors (replacing windows in that location) will allow for access down to the patio (currently existing, but in need of improvement).  This egress area and patio is buffered by a 6 feet high fence at the property line, which provides privacy.","No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the relocated, enlarged and new windows and doors should have a limited impact on abutters. With the exception of the immediate rear abutters, there are no other inhabitants or passersby who will be able to see the altered and new windows due to their location at the rear of this relatively small home tucked back from the street with larger buildings to the rear and right side.  (See photo of the rear of the house taken from the sidewalk on Gray Street).  The residences that abut the new egress doors have few or no windows from which to see the new doors, and thus should not experience any nuisance or hazard.  The petitioners will cause all construction to comply with State Building Code and other fire code requirements applicable to openings located near a property line.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the window alterations, new windows and doors will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.","Boston","MA","05/29/2019"

The added floor space of the proposed addition, which triggers the variance is needed to add a second bathroom to this floor. Having only the single bathroom on this floor is a hardship, as the family prepares for work and school at the same time every morning, and the lack of privacy between the adults and soon to be teenage daughters. The first floor has no coat closet at either front or rear entry, and only one half bath, which was installed (by the previous owner) in the dining room. The proposed rear addition, located on the footprint of the existing covered screen porch, would provide space for a rear entry, coat closets, and the re-location of the half bath to that area. The lack of closet space at the front and rear entries, makes everyday living difficult, and having the only first floor toilet room opening directly into the dining room is neither compatible nor healthy.","The proposed two story addition will only add approximately 165 sq.ft. to the habitable area of the existing house, since the addition is to be located on the footprint of the one story existing covered screen porch.

They were planning to remove the rear deck when they realized that it is actually a roof over a portion of the original basement that protrudes from the main rectangle of the house footprint. In looking at historic photographs of the house in its original state, they saw that it used to have a one-story ell at the rear of the first floor that was undoubtedly part of what is now a curtailed kitchen area. The current house is very small, and southern light limited by a very tall Harvard Street-structure on the adjacent lot. Since the Owners were planning to renovate the kitchen and do it in such a way that some of the original character of the house be restored while trying to get as much precious southern light as possible into the first floor, they were moved to request a zoning variance in order to restore the missing first floor portion. The existing deck/roof structure is susceptible to leaking, and the addition would provide much needed kitchen pantry space.","The proposed ell addition is actually the restoration of an original portion of the house. Its scale, especially in relation to is looming neighbor to the south, is quite minimal. Very little additional shadow is cast by it onto any adjacent property since it is only one-story in height and faces south. No density is increased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal since it doesn't increase the quantity of living units in the neighborhood.","The proposal does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property.","The 1886 house was constructed with the rear ell that the Owners are requesting permission to re-build, and included a lasting, contiguous foundation below the ell. When it was constructed, there existed to the south of the house, at 345 Harvard Street, a double house from 1856 including a large lot of open space between the two houses. In 1961 the double house was razed and a 5-story apartment block was constructed that encroached sginificantly on that open land to within 10' of the rear property line separating the two lots. While the proposed addition violates the side and rear setbacks for a current C-1 district, it is a modest addition of only 6', utilizing an existing foundation, and the violation is minimal. The lot is an unusual double square shape, and the addition actually does conform to the rear yard setback taken from the very rear-most property line. The shape hints that land losses and acquisitions over the last 150 years have taken place that culminated in a house on an eccentric lot that meets some setbacks well and violates others. The Owners are hoping to respectfully and minimally increase the size of a small kitchen, eliminate a problematic and unwanted deck, and make changes that have value as historic restoration of an original structure.","The proposed window changes on the west side of the house increase the width of one double-hung window by 8"" and move it northward by 2', and decrease the height of another double hung window by 15"" while keeping it in the same location.  The net square footage of glass remains almost the same in the proposal as exists there now.  Therefore, no burdensome light will be increased for abutting neighbors.","No traffic will be generated nor patters of access altered by this proposal, thus there will be no substantial change in the character of the neighborhood and no hazardous congestion created by it.","No nuisance or hazard causing detriment to the health safety, or welfare of the occupants nor the citizents of the City of Cambridge will be created by this proposal.","The proposal would not impair the integrity of the district nor the adjoining district, nor would it in any other way derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.",NA,"Cambridge","MA","07/12/2017"

The development of the unit was restricted to the main floor with no basement because of the possible legal costs to rectify environmental conditions of subgrade soil of the industrial buiding was too much of a hardship for the original development to address. The lack of exterior open space and a children's room can be resolved by adding a roof deck and penthouse. The penthouse would also compensate for the loss of floor area on the compact first floor when adding the staircase. The proposed building height would only be 2 stories in a 3 story allowable district. Making the existing setbacks more detrimental are also avoided by keeping the penthouse setback from the parapet of existing first floor.","n/a","n/a","n/a","n/a","n/a","Cambridge","ma","10/11/2017"

It was one of three multi-family houses on a small street currently zoned A-2.  As we started to plan for a family, we petitioned for and were granted a variance for the BZA in 1986 to add a shed dormer to the attic to make it a third bedroom.  This variance expired as our family plans were unexpectedly delayed.  By 1994, with a 3 yr old son and a hoping for a second child, we converted the house to a 1-family residence.  This alteration did not require a special permit or variance.Twenty+ years later, we would very much like to stay in our home (and with the neighbors we've known for up to a third of a century!) for as long as our health allows.  Financially, however, we anticipate this becoming a hardship and a burden on our retirement savings.  We are also worried that maintenance will also become burdensome, physically and financially, unless we cut back on our living space.So, we ask the BZA to allow us to convert our home back to its original 2-family status.  To have a unit rentable to a young family (we are one block from the highly desirable Graham and Parks School), and space taht woudl allow us to have live-in care if needed, we ask for a small increase in the living area (63 sq ft more to the existing 4374 sq ft), that will alllow for two well-configured units.  The configuration is similar to the orginal:  unit 1 is the first floor plus the southeast corner of the 2nd floor; unit 2 is the bulk of the 2nd floor plus the attic floor with new shed dormers to the east and west (and removal of the south dormer).","We have consulted with the east and west abutters, and they have all approved of our plan. We will consult with the rear abutters (a condo association) sufficiently prior to our hearing to make any changes necessary to get their approval.  More generally, the visual impact from the street side is minimal due to the extensive mature foundation plantings.  This will also be reviewed by the Avon Hill Conservation Commission.","Rather than derogating from the intent of the Ordinance, we believe this plan is very much in keeping with the spirit of the recent changes to support the addition of accessory apartments to assist with the severe housing shortage in Cambridge.  While too large to be an accessory apartment (we looked into this but were hindered by egress, financial, and other concerns), we believe restoring our house to its original 2-family use is in keeping with goals of the City.","Like many older Cambridge residences, our home was non-conforming along numerous dimensions when we bought it in 1984.  These included total gross floor area, lot area, FAR, lot area per unit, lot width, and setbacks on two sides. We believe the only thing that has changed in all of these areas since 1984 is that sometime between our 1986 variance and today, our side of Bate St was rezoned from B to A-2 to be like the rest of the street. So, the hardship that leads us to need a variance is due to the original circumstances of the original building and lot being non-conforming, plus the subsequent rezoning.","Our east (left) side setback is only 5ft, so that construction or exterior changes on the east side requires a Special Permit.  The proposed construction is to add a new door to the facade for the 2nd floor unit, a bicycle shed, and new windows on the east wall for additonal light.  The door/windows will be in a style to match the current building.  Second, the rear setback is 20 ft vs. the required 25ft.  On this side, we request to add two new windows, in exactly the same style as the existing, and a spiral staircase down from the rear 2nd floor porch to ground level as the 2nd means of egress from the 2nd floor unit. This staircase will be largely hidden from all neighbors by large trees and a wall on the west side.","The area between our house and the house to east is rarely used (we call it ""Siberia"").   There is no easy access for our house, and it is used as a rear and basement entrance to our neighbor's house.  There will be no impact on the character of the building, or the neighborhood in terms of traffic.The rear staircase empties into our rear fenced-in yard, so will have no impact on neighbors.","The existing uses for the south side would continue as they have been without change.  On the east side, the close neighbor does not believe there will be any impact on her family.","The entrance to the new 2nd floor unit would be protected from the street by the large existing plantings.","The changes requested related to the Special Permit will be quite discrete from the street view.","Cambridge","MA","03/07/2018"

Construction type for proposed screened porch is wood framing.","The current owners have resided at this property since 1990. Both dwelling units are occupied by members of the same extended family. They are seeking a space to enjoy the outdoors--protected from sun, precipitation, and insects--and large enough to seat frequent gatherings of 10-12 family members. Currently there is no screened porch on the property.The Hoefgen-Harvey family is committed to their home and neighborhood, and the addition of a screened porch will allow the family to remain in their home longer. As the family ages, they intend to travel less and use their backyard more. They are also seeking a covered place to protect their outdoor furniture, because storing outdoor furniture in the basement or elsewhere has become increasingly difficult as the owners grow older.Risk from mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) are highest from May through October, and from dusk until dawn. Periods of highest mosquito risk coincide with the seasons and times the owners would most like to enjoy the outdoors: summers and early fall, and dinners during cooler temperatures after sundown.The following information was posted online at the Cambridge Public Health Department website (www.cambridgepublichealth.org):WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV):On July 13, 2017, a mosquito sample in Cambridge tested positive for West Nile Virus.On July 17, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health raised the risk of West Nile Virus infection from “low” to ""moderate"" in Boston, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Watertown.“We are advising residents to start taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing repellent or protective clothing in the evening, fixing screens, and eliminating standing water on their property,” said Claude Jacob, the city’s Chief Public Health Officer and director of the Cambridge Public Health Department.The risk of West Nile Virus, which can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, typically rises through the summer, peaking in August.People over 50 are at greatest risk for serious illness from WNV, especially those with weakened immune systems. Ages of the Hoefgen-Harvey household range from 7 to 84, with three occupants over the age of 50. EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS (EEE):As of October 10, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health listed Cambridge in the EEE Risk Category of “REMOTE”. But even in the “REMOTE” category, repairs to insect screens are recommended as a protective measure.Currently there are no available vaccines to prevent human infections from either WNV or EEE. Personal protection measures that serve to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and thereby prevent human infection remain the mainstays of prevention.In Massachusetts over the last ten years, some human EEE cases have occurred outside of the historic area of risk and there have been year-to-year variations in the geographic pattern of disease occurrence. Climate change and warmer seasonal temperatures are expected to increase the risk and expand the range of EEE, and other insect-borne diseases, over time.Outbreaks of EEE usually occur in Massachusetts every 10-20 years. These outbreaks will typically last two to three years. The most recent outbreak of EEE in Massachusetts began in 2004 and included 13 cases with six fatalities through 2006.In Massachusetts, about half of the people identified with EEE died from the infection. People who survive this disease will often be permanently disabled. Few people recover completely.","The proposed screened porch is at the rear of the property, and generally will not be seen by the public. The neighbors living immediately adjacent to the porch at 16-18 Haskell Street—Anne Mock and Chris Chan--have expressed their support, as well as other residents of the neighborhood.There will be no expansion of enclosed, conditioned space; no increase in the total number of occupants; and no decrease of parking on the property.This screened porch would be unlikely to be enclosed in the future because it will be common to both dwelling units, and not directly connected to either unit.The proposed project would increase quality of the housing in the City of Cambridge by improving the livability and appearance of the existing residence.","Relief would ease the constraints presented by this particular, nonconforming property without undermining the overall Ordinance intent.Relief is requested only where necessary. Proposed screened porch otherwise conforms to setback, open space, height, and other zoning requirements. The residential nature of the property will not change.Relief is requested only to help the existing residence provide the Ordinance intent of providing safe conditions for the occupants to enjoy the outdoors, while respecting the surrounding neighborhood.Article 1.30 “PURPOSE” of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance identifies the following desirable purposes: “conserve health”, “conserve the value of land and buildings”, and “encourage the most rational use of land throughout the city, including the encouragement of appropriate economic development.” We believe our proposal satisfies all three of these goals.","The existing single family residence on the property was constructed in 1891, prior to the adoption of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The residence is currently non-conforming with respect to FAR, front yard setback, and side yard setback. Any modification to FAR requires relief.The FAR hardship is specific to the property, and not the surrounding district. Adjacent building lots at 8-10 Haskell (6,995 sq ft), 12-14 Haskell (7,130 sq ft), and 16-18 Haskell (6,535 sq ft) have similar street frontage to this property. The owners’ lot, however, is chamfered at the rear due to the existing street pattern and Rindge Avenue, and therefore unusually small for this area (5,615 sq ft).",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cambridge","MA","07/26/2018"

Literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would involve substantial hardship because:•	They will not be able to gain sufficient living space to accommodate significant life style changes without creating the proposed attic living space, 2nd floor laundry, and 2nd floor office. Numerous alternate designs were considered, but all required variance relief, or were unworkable or less desirable in terms of functionality and negative impacts to abutters. •	If the goals of the addition cannot be met, Petitioners, who have multi-generational ties to this home and this neighborhood, will need to move, disrupting their long-standing connections with the City, the Strawberry Hill neighborhood and Holworthy Street (described below). Lifestyle Changes: Petitioners have lived in the house for 28 years, during which they both worked fulltime jobs requiring long hours and frequent travel. Consequently, they did not spend much time actually at home. Martha has retired and Robert now works from home. They have found that the house does not have sufficient space to accommodate their at-home needs, interests, and family visits. The goal of their proposal is to create a house that allows them to age in place, is a comfort and pleasure to live in, has a welcoming exterior and entranceway, preserves privacy for them and their neighbors, and has traditional design elements. Through careful design, they have sought to create additional space without simply building a “big box” to gain square footage, and instead to design a home that is compatible with the surrounding homes and is appealing but does not “look out of place” on the street.  Connections to City and Neighborhood: Petitioners have a strong connection and attachment to the house, Strawberry Hill neighborhood, and the City. The house was built by Robert’s grandparents, Anna and Raymond Patten, in 1958. Robert’s family has lived on Holworthy Street and the surrounding blocks back as many as five generations. Robert and Martha have both worked in Cambridge for many years, and have developed strong bonds in their neighborhood of Strawberry Hill.","The proposed house will not result in substantial detriment to the public good. The proposed cross-gable colonial house front facade and roof pitch complement nearby one- and two-family homes (see photographs in Figures 5 and 6).The mass, shape, height, and roofline of the proposed renovation is more consistent, with most neighborhood homes, than the existing house and consequently will fit in with neighborhood better than the existing home.The existing back yard open space is maintained and provides relief from building density for the Petitioners and also their abutters (see photographs in Figures 3 and 7).Based on comparison to 11 neighboring one- and two-family houses comprising the Hearing Notice List, the proposed building’s footprint, gross floor area, and FAR are all below the midpoint and the average of the range of the Notice List houses.  The percent private open space (most of which can be seen by abutting houses), is above the midpoint and the average of the range of the Notice List houses, and will be remain so after the proposed construction.There will be no change in occupancy, therefore no additional cars will impact street congestion or parking. There will be no impact on solar systems now or in the future because the house will not be higher than buildings to the east, north or west.Finally, a growing family can use the proposed house, without expansion in the future, thereby improving the housing stock of Cambridge and aligning with a general goal of the City.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Maintain valued open space for the benefit of the petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Help conserve the value of this building and conserve natural resources by providing the necessary upgrades to the existing home’s primary systems, windows, and insulation•	Help conserve the value of surrounding buildings by maintaining open space.•	Improve the housing stock of Cambridge through creation of a home that allows the next owners to raise a young family in Cambridge, “therefore it will preserve and increase the amenities of the City”•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The house is a pre-existing nonconforming structure owing to the small (4,125 sf.) lot size and shape (narrowing from front to back of lot); the Lot Area and existing side yard setbacks do not meet current dimensional requirements. The topography of the lot, which rises 10 feet from behind the house to the rear lot line, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, impacts potential for expansion to the back. The steep slope behind the house requires two sets of retaining walls. The back slope, the retaining walls, and the small side yards limit the possibilities of expansion of the house to the rear or to the sides because of problems of access to the back yard for construction equipment and materials, difficulties and increased costs associated with excavation for a new foundation, cutting into the back retaining walls, and generating excess volumes of soil that would need to be transported off-site, chemically tested and disposed. Furthermore, expanding into the back yard (without further violating the side yard setbacks) would require bringing the side walls in towards the center of the property, resulting in an awkward floor plan layout and an architecturally unattractive house. Finally such construction would greatly reduce the open space of the back yard.FAR – The Petitioners evaluated alternative designs for achieving the needed additional living space (that might be achieved under the FAR limit of 0.5).  However, they found that even the simplest scenario of expanding the second floor from a ¾ story to a full second floor and providing an adequately sloped gable roof resulted in additional GFA and an FAR over 0.5, and would not provide the space and rooms needed.","The proposed renovation includes altering and adding windows in the nonconforming side setbacks to accommodate the altered and new room configurations and provide natural light and ventilation, requiring special permit relief in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.  The proposed window placement will afford the adjacent neighbors increased privacy over the current window placement by increasing the off-set from the East neighbor’s existing windows and decreasing the window size in the case of the second floor West wall windows.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character because the proposed house will continue as a single-family house as the Petitioners’ home.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed remodeling of the house and altered and new window placement will not adversely affect neighboring uses.","Use of the house and property will continue as a single-family house and yard. No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed renovation project or by the future use of the property by the Petitioners.","A change of use is not proposed and the house will continue as a single-family house, therefore the use of the house will not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district.","Boston","MA","12/12/2018"

There is not sufficient driveway (side lot) width to allow for the five foot setback requirement to be met.The parking spaces will serve this property only and their proximity to the building will not cause any detriment to any other property or to the public interest.

This rear door will be the only code-compliant common entry and exit for the building. The front door currently has an exterior canopy protecting it but inadequate landing space in front of the door at the top of the brick steps leading to it.","The closest abutter to the proposed canopy is a public way (the new DCR bike path), not a residential neighbor. To the extent that yard setbacks are partly intended to ensure minimum fire separation distances between neighborhing buildings, the bike path lends considerable extra distance to the nearest structure to the east or south of the proposed canopy.","The modest ""floor area"" the proposed canopy requires is entirely exterior space, not enclosed habitable space. While it increases the F.A.R. by just .002 per cent, its impact on the neighborhood is negligible. Also, along with this canopy and new door location is the opportunity to remove approximately 18 square feet of brick steps currently serving the existing south side entrance. This yard area will be replaced with permeable materials.","The lot is both undersized and triangular in shape. Due to the unusual shape of the lot and the configuration of rooms within the house, the only reasonable and practicall location for a new code-compliant stair and grade level exit door is at the proposed location. Consequently, because this location falls within the non-conforming portion of the house with regard to setbacks, it is also not feasible for an exterior roof canopy to meet the full rear or side yard setback requirement.","While the proposed dormers increase headroom at the third floor, they do not increase the existing floor area ration (F.A.R.). Also, while previous additions increased the volume of the house to 21% over its original volume, the proposed dormers only bring this overage up to 22% and therfore the volume of the house will still be below the 25% maximum limit stated in Article 8.22.2 paragraph c. The dormers conform to all dimensional setback and height limtis of Article 5.0, and they have no impact on existing off-street parking. Finally, the deisgn of the dormers is in full compliance with published ZBA guidelines for dormers. The proposed changes to window and door openings within the non-conforming portion of the structure are necessary in order to accomodate a redesigned interior exit stair which will better serve both apartments and also the basement. The existing interior stair is extremely narrow and unsafe and has its narrow exit door onto the rear enclosed porch rather than directly to the exterior. Also, there is currently no code-compliant exit from the basement level which is used for residents' storage and mechanical equipment. Despite the fact that the new window and door openings are still within a non-conforming portion of the strucutre, they are nonetheless farther afield the property line than those that are being removed, and they significantly enhance life saftey via improved  building egress.","Neither the roof dormers, nor the window and door relocations pose substantial change to the neighborhood character, traffic generation. Building egress is improved for residents without negatively impacting neighborhood.","Neither the roof dormers nor the window and door relocations would affect the continued operation or  development of adjacent uses in any way, there being no change in proposed use.","Neither the roof dormers nor the window and door relocations would create a nuisance or hazard for anyone, there being no change in proposed use.","The roof dormers and the window and door relocations have been designed to integrate with other previously permitted work on the building and if approved will enhance the overall integrity of the structure.","Boston","MA","03/13/2020"

Petitioner was before this Board of Zoning Appeal seeking special permit relief in order to alter window openings and install a door within setbacks which was granted (BZA-016276-2018). At that time, plans called for ceiling heights in the basement to remain below 7  feet. After renovations in the basement were nearly completed, Petitioner was informed by Inspectional Services that the newly installed bathroom in the basement would have to conform to the commercial building code requirement of 7 feet ceilings, thus rendering the new bathroom non-compliant due to its current ceiling height of 6 ft, 11 inches. Thus, Petitioner now seeks this Special Permit to exempt from the Gross Floor Area the areas of the basement shown on the plans as a bathroom, laundry and finished room. Such exemption meets the standards set forth in Ordinance Article 2, Gross Floor Area, Excluded, footnote 16, where such basement use otherwise meets all other dimensional requirements under Article 5.31 and will not otherwise exacerbate any existing non-conformity of the building. Furthermore, renovations have either been completed (eg., installation of the new bathroom and laundry), occuring within the existing structure, and will have no impact on neighboring uses and are consistent with similar basement uses in the area.","Petitioner's requested relief and proposed renovation in the existing basement will not result in additional bedrooms nor otherwise allow for additional occupancies in the dwelling. Additionally, the requested exemption will have no impact on patterns of access or egress from the dwelling.  Thus, the Special Permit relief will have no impact on traffic, congestion hazard, or changes to the neighborhood character. And in fact, such minimal use of the basement of the structure is in keeping with similar residential uses in this district and throughout the City of Cambridge, allowing for improved living conditions for residents of three-family residences.","For reasons described above, there will be no adverse impacts on adjacent uses as a result of the requested relief.","There will be no nuisance or hazard created as a result of allowing the basement renovations as described herein, and in fact such renovations will improve health and safety for the occupants of the building.","The proposed renovations to create livable space, including a code compliant bathroom, laundry and finished room in the basement of this three-family dwelling will not impair the integrity of the district, as it would conform with a growingly common phenomena for homeowners of seeking to maximize use of limited residential space within aged, pre-existing, non-conforming three-family structures within residential neighborhoods throughout the City of Cambridge. In fact, this type of relief is consistent with the type of accomodation the City is seeking to allow for when it voted to pass the basement exemption amendment to the Zoning Ordinance.","Boston","MA","09/04/2019"

In 1980, the BZA granted zoning relief to allow for parking of two compact cars in this location, in connection with a variance to allow for the conversion of the garage to a single-family residence. Parking for two vehicles would have been necessary in order for the second dwelling unit to comply with minimum parking requirements. Notwithstanding this 1980 Decision, there is now uncertainty as to whether the special permit was ever acted upon with regard to parking.  Recent history suggests the parking area may not have been widened enough (to the full proposed 14 ft. wide) or used for two cars as proposed. This case arises as a result of a query from a prospective purchaser of one of the newly created condominium units and the Building Commissioner’s determination that he could not confirm, upon the evidence presented, that a second parking space is legally established in this location.A literal enforcement of the ordinance imposes substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, on the owners of this two-family residential property, rendering the property non-compliant in terms of the minimum parking requirements.  There are no alternative parking plans that would comply with dimensional requirement of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.  The plans presented to the BZA represent a plan with the most minimal impacts on neighboring uses with the most minimal zoning relief necessary.  There are no physical alterations required in order to create the parking area called for in this application (16 ft., 2 inches wide and 18 ft., 10 inches deep). The only physical change from the perspective of the neighborhood would be the use of such space for the parking of two (instead of one) vehicles.","Variance relief from the requirements of Section 6.44.1(c) may be granted without any detriment to the public good.  There is currently (and by right) a parking area located in the front yard setback that has been used for at least 35 years for the parking of one vehicle.  There will be minimal impacts to neighbor of an addition of one vehicle in this location.  Similar front yard parking conditions occur throughout the neighborhood and the District and throughout the City.  There already exists a curb cut in this location. Allowing an additional vehicle to park in this location will result in improved conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioners are able to park two cars on their property, thereby removing a car from on street parking in this neighborhood, which will have a net positive benefit for the public. There will be no adverse impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In fact, the changes to parking will improve these conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioner is able to park on their Property (and not on the City street).","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing for the benefit of the Petitioners and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the siting of the structures on this undersized lot, and the prior grant of a variance to allow for use as a two-family residence together with a grant of rights to park two (2) vehicles that may not have been acted upon by a prior owner.

This property consists of two, single-family structures: a front building originally constructed in approximately 1865, being renovated,, and a new single-family structure located behind.  The renovation and new construction are underway pursuant to a building permit previously issued by the City of Cambridge.  The petitioner seeks to make modifications to the approved plans in order to construct a rear landing and stairs off the rear of the front building on the property, in order to create a means of egress from the first floor of the front building down to the patio and yard.  The landing and stairs would vastly improve the egress conditions for future owners, while minimizing negative impacts to the neighboring properties and this historic neighborhood.  The landing and stairs would only minimally encroach (less than 3 feet) into required space between the two buildings required pursuant to Article 5, Section 5.13 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance of 11.2 feet.  The shortest distance measured between the exterior foundation walls of the two buildings is 11.9 ft, which is greater than the minimum required distance of 11.2 feet.  The landing and stairs located within the space between the buildings meet the requirements described in Article 5, Section 5.24.1 (“unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above the average level of the adjoining ground”), and thus pursuant to Section 5.24.1, the landing and stairs should be allowed to “extend beyond the minimum yard regulations otherwise provided for the district in which the structure is built.”  Under this interpretation, the landing and stairs would be permissible, without requirement of a variance.  However, in the event that the Board does not agree with this interpretation and in the alternative, the Petitioner hereby requests the Board find that the modest encroachment requested in this application be allowed as a variance, since a literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from making a desirable improvement to this home.","The requested relief may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because the encroachment into the space between the two buildings is minimal (less than 3 feet), and will not be visible to the public. There will be no negative impacts to the abutters.  In fact, the siting of the landing and stairs will pose the least impact on abutters, due to their location tucked behind the existing front building.  Any alternative location for this second means of egress would be less desirable and more detrimental to the public good, by creating more substantial encroachment into the right-side setback, or jutting out left of the structure and thereby detracting from the historic design of the front building and intruding into the open space.There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to vastly improve the egress conditions for the front building, and allow for the preservation of open space on the property.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the structure, the topography (sloping down) of the lot, which results in the necessity of a rear landing and stairs down from the first floor to grade at the rear of the structure.  Additionally, the front building is an historic structure, and the design of the second egress is constrained by historic design considerations that are unique to this property.","Petitioner seeks to add one basement window on the right side of the front building on the property.  This new window is necessary and desirable to improve light and air ventilation in the basement of this building.  As it is located on the right side of the building which is pre-existing, nonconforming within the side yard setback, the installation of the window requires a special permit in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character, but will vastly improve the conditions within the home.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed basement window of the house, and adjacent uses will not be adversely affected by the requested special permit relief.  The basement window will be screened from view of the neighboring property by plantings and a four-foot high picket fence and will therefore not be seen by the immediate neighbors or the public passing by on the street.","As described above, no nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the basement window will be screened from view of the neighboring property by plantings and a four-foot high picket fence.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the new basement window will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.","Boston","MA","10/15/2020"

Construction costs will be substantial, and the owner seeks to make several improvements that will be necessary to insure the structural soundness of the project. Due to the currently non-conforming nature of the structure, specifically its size (which exceeds current allowable Floor Area Ratio and side and rear setbacks for the Residence B district), these very modest changes will result in minimal modifications to a non-conforming structure that increase the current non-conformity. Under a recent Supreme Judicial Court decision, Maria Bellalta & another vs. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline & others, SJC-12516, Slip Opinion dated February 8, 2019, such de minimus alterations to a pre-existing non-conforming two-family structure such as this one should be allowed to proceed with a finding of this Board under G.L. c. 40A, Section 6, upon a finding of “no substantial detriment” – in essence, a special permit standard. (See a copy of the Slip Opinion for Bellalta v. ZBA Brookline, included in this BZA application).  The Petitioner has been advised by the Commissioner of Inspectional Services that this Board may not hear this case on such basis unless and until the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance has been amended to reflect the import of the Bellalta decision.  Thus, the Petitioner hereby requests the Board find that the modest alterations requested in this application be allowed as a variance under Article 5, Section 5.3000, since a literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from making necessary and desirable improvements to this two-family home. The following alterations result in an increase in Floor Area requiring a variance: a) reconstructing (on a flat plane) he front wall of the home to remove bay feature that has resulted in water infiltration and drainage issues; b) expanding attic level dormer to allow for sufficient head space to create livable space in the currently unusable attic; and c) rebuilding the roof to the rear second-floor porch that was destroyed after storm and wood rot damage resulted in the roof failing and being demolished for safety reasons","The relief from Dimensional Standards of Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because the changes are very minimal – a small increase in Floor Area, occurring within the existing footprint of the structure.  The expanded dormer (from 12.5 ft. to 15 ft.) which is set back from the street in compliance with dimensional standards, will not negatively impact the neighbors on that side.  The change to the front wall of the house will not further encroach, and increased square footage will have no adverse impacts for abutters. Replacing the rear porch roof will not negatively impact neighbors as this was a condition that had been in place for decades prior to its recent demolition. There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to proceed with plans to undertake a significant renovation to an historic two-family home that might otherwise be demolished by a less industrious, less-historically-minded owner.  As such, a grant of variance relief will allow for the rehabilitation of a historic, two-family home and restoration of the existing housing stock that will be desirable for future residents.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the interior layout of the structure, the siting of the structure on this undersized, narrow lot, and on account of storm and structural failure which lead to loss of the rear second-floor porch roof prior to the Petitioner’s purchase of the home.  The modest (14 square feet) increase in Floor Area are the result of alterations that are necessary for construction/structural reasons (to rebuild a porch roof after storm and structural failure) or to allow for additional much-needed, living space for future inhabitants.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boston","MA","06/28/2019"
