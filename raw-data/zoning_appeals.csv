However, there is an existing 10'-6"" dormer on the opposite side of the roof, and that older dormer meets the ridge line.  Therefore, it seems preferrable for the proposed dormer to to match the existing dormer profile and achieve symmetry in slope and roof profile.  The proposed dormer design is traditional in appearance, there is only a very modest increase in FAR (only 55.78 additional gross square feet), creates no new shadows on adjacent lots or increase in traffic flow.

Kennedy Street. The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Side yard setback at the proposed “West Pavilion.” (CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum side yard)•	To permit a setback ranging from 17’ – 23’ from the JFK Park Pedestrian Connector, conforming to prior BZA findings with respect to future development on this site. Variance 2: Height of proposed loading bays. (CZO 6.91, Location and Layout of Loading Facilities.)•	To permit a loading bay height of 13’ 6” in the proposed new loading facility (14’ is required). Variance 3: Width of proposed curb cut. (CZO 6.92, Location and Layout of Loading Facilities.)•	To permit a curb cut width at Eliot Street of 41’ (30’ is maximum). Project DescriptionAmong the goals of the proposed campus development project is to provide additional and improved teaching and study space, the creation of an environment that supports greater collaboration and active learning, and to address key physical shortcomings in the existing HKS campus including conflicts in vehicular and pedestrian circulation, compromised off-street loading facilities, and limited campus services such as a kitchen and dining facilities. To achieve these goals the HKS proposes new development on its campus that will add 76,540 square feet of new gross floor area in three additions:1)	the “Gateway Building,” a two-level addition connecting the existing Taubman Building and Belfer Center at the 3rd and 4th Floors.  This addition will contain faculty offices and meeting space;2)	the “West Pavilion,” a four-level addition connecting the existing Taubman Building with the David Rubenstein Building.  This addition will contain classrooms, meeting spaces, faculty offices, and building support spaces; 3)	the “South Pavilion,” a four-level addition which will connect the existing Littauer Building and the proposed “West Pavilion.”  This addition will contain classrooms, meeting spaces, faculty offices, new campus kitchen and dining facilities, and building support space. The South Building will also create a new landscaped courtyard space between Littauer and Rubenstein. The courtyard will covered by a glass roof, creating a new winter garden.  In addition to the building additions, a major component of the project is to raise the level of most of the existing courtyard by approximately 13’ to generally align with the grade level of adjacent streets at key pedestrian access points (at Eliot Street beneath the proposed Gateway Building and at the west side from the JFK Park pedestrian connector ). The raised courtyard will preserve the central campus green space while creating a new lower level that contains a below-grade loading facility, additional program space and building mechanical space. The proposed new campus development will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance with the exception of the following three elements which require zoning relief:• The setback of the “West Pavilion,” located between the existing Rubenstein and Taubman buildings, is consistent with the alignment of existing campus buildings, and is also in conformance with prior BZA findings with respect to future development on this site. However strict compliance with the calculation of the required side yard setback along the JFK Park pedestrian connector requires zoning relief.• Due to the structural limitations of the site, a variance is required for the height of the facility’s loading bays.• A dimensional variance for the width of the proposed curb cut accessing the off-street loading facility to facilitate the safe movement of delivery vehicles.Setback at “West Pavilion”The existing HKS campus was developed in phases between 1978 and 1990.  The buildings which comprise the campus have been designed with street walls along the campus edges surrounding an open courtyard.  This pattern of development echoes the traditional organization of buildings and open space found at the Harvard Houses located nearby and other parts of the Harvard campus.  The David Rubenstein and Taubman buildings received zoning dimensional variances for their required side yard setbacks at the JFK Park pedestrian connector. The variances granted for Phase IV (Taubman Building) contained conditions that the Taubman building should be set back approximately eight (8) feet from the property line, aligning with Phase III (Rubenstein Building).  The BZA additionally found that future buildings along the connector should continue a minimum setback of eight (8) feet. The addition of the West Pavilion will result in the existing interconnected buildings along the length of the JFK Park pedestrian connector to be treated as a single building for the purposes of zoning.  Due to the length of the resulting building, a literal enforcement of the setback provisions would result in a single plane side yard setback requirement of 86’.  To achieve this setback, new construction would be required to take place near the center of the courtyard, effectively eliminating the campus’ central organizing feature and resulting in a significant reduction in existing open space. As proposed, the West Pavilion will have a setback ranging from 8’ – 23’ from the pedestrian connector, which meets the minimum setback of 8’ feet recommended for future buildings as part of the zoning variance granted by the BZA for the Taubman Building.  The requested variance will allow the central courtyard to continue to serve as the central organizing feature of the campus and to provide publically accessible open space which contributes to a network of diverse open spaces on the Harvard campus and in Harvard Square.Loading Bay HeightThe existing HKS campus is currently served by a loading facility located behind the Belfer building which is accessed from Eliot Street via the central courtyard.  Given its location, the facility does not adequately serve the campus. The current location also creates circulation conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, delivery vehicles, and other vehicles entering the campus, as they all use the same access drive from Eliot Street. The proposed campus development will create a new loading facility beneath the raised courtyard structure that will be centrally located with direct access to campus service and support spaces. The new location will have a dedicated and separated vehicle entrance from Eliot Street, eliminating pedestrian and vehicular conflicts within the central courtyard. CZO standards for the location and layout of loading facilities require that all loading bays be no less than fourteen (14) feet in height.   The bays in the proposed loading facility will have a height of 13’ 6”.  The proposed height can accommodate the largest vehicles which serve the campus (trucks with a 40’ wheelbase and a maximum vehicle height of 12’ 6”).  Bay height is limited due to the nature of the underlying foundation structure of the HKS campus (see B below).  A literal enforcement of the CZO provisions would require actions that would be detrimental to the function and feasibility of the below-grade loading dock, the courtyard, or the surrounding buildings. The 1911 MBTA rail yard slab which lies beneath the entire HKS campus and JFK Park presents a finite lower limit to practical mass excavation. Depressing the loading dock further would require completely removing a large section of the MBTA slab, inviting further structural, drainage and other complications. The option of raising the roof structure of the dock higher would result in raising the elevation of the courtyard above. This change would remove pedestrian connections between the courtyard and existing buildings and the JFK Park pedestrian walkway to the west of the site. It would also compromise the connection between the new buildings at the courtyard elevation and the existing buildings on campus.Curb Cut WidthCZO 6.92 specifies a maximum 30’ curb cut width for loading facilities. The proposed design for a wider curb cut (41') is based on an analysis of truck turning movements that demonstrated significant improvements for truck movements and overall safety with the widened curb cut.  The proposed curb cut will improve turning movements for vehicles entering and exiting the loading facility driveway thereby reducing conflicts with vehicular and bicycle traffic on Eliot Street.  A literal enforcement of the provisions of the CZO 6.92 would require a significantly narrower curb cut, which given the site geometry, would result in vehicle turning movements that would have greater impact on Eliot Street vehicular and bicycle traffic.",The proposed new development will result in significant public benefits including: improved pedestrian access to the HKS campus by creating new at grade connections at Eliot Street and the JFK Park pedestrian connector that will facilitate cross campus circulation to other points in Harvard Square; a renewed central courtyard with improved connections to the network of existing open spaces in the Square; elimination of pedestrian and vehicular conflicts within the central courtyard; greatly improved access to the campus for persons with disabilities; and public realm improvements at campus edges and key entrances. The proposed project is consistent with the City’s institutional growth policies which encourage increased utilization of existing institutional facilities and sites.  The project will use sustainable construction methods and materials with a goal of achieving LEED Gold certification.,"The proposed development will comply fully with current CZO requirements with the exception of the requested relief.  The setback of the West Pavilion is consistent with existing development on the site, and meets the conditions for future development set forth in the BZA’s prior variance decision for the adjacent Taubman Building. The new off-street loading facility will appropriately serve the needs of the campus and eliminates existing circulation conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and delivery vehicles, while enabling safe delivery vehicle turning movements at Eliot Street. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will permit the significant improvement of the functionality and operation of the HKS campus, and its public amenity to Harvard Square.","Setback at “West Pavilion”The existing HKS campus was developed incrementally over a period of 12 years.  The resulting pattern of development is characterized by strong street walls at the campus edges surrounding a landscaped central courtyard echoing the traditional organization of buildings and open space elsewhere on the Harvard campus. This development pattern has been facilitated by variances previously granted by the BZA for required setbacks.  Both the pattern of existing campus development and the site’s physical constraints are unique to the HKS property and do not generally affect other properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.  Loading Bay HeightThe HKS campus was developed on the former site of MBTA rail yards. Due to its riverfront location, and wet soil conditions, the rail yards were originally constructed atop a massive 4’ thick concrete slab supported on wooden pilings.  All of the Harvard Kennedy School buildings are constructed atop this pre-existing monumental foundation slab. This unique structural condition creates constraints on future campus development by precluding excavation below the level of the existing slab. The existing and proposed buildings make use of foundation elements that pierce the MBTA slab at selected locations, but removal of large areas of the slab presents technical challenges at the site. Major excavation of the slab structure would require extensive and costly modification to the foundation and pile system due to the underlying soil and water table conditions.  Furthermore, records suggest that portions of the JFK Park to the south of the Harvard Kennedy School site are drained beneath the existing MBTA slab, and removal of large areas of the slab could compromise this drainage system despite localized repairs.  The presence of the pre-existing concrete slab is a site condition that is unique to the HKS campus and does not generally affect the properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.  Curb Cut WidthThe section of Eliot Street fronting the HKS campus is oriented to the site at an approximately 67 degree angle, creating a site geometry that is at odds with the orientation of campus buildings and site circulation. The orientation of Eliot Street to the campus requires a wider curb cut to permit delivery vehicle turning movements that reduce conflicts with vehicular and bicycle traffic on Eliot Street.  The campus’ orientation to Eliot Street is unique to the site and does not generally affect the properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,03/27/2015

Based upon the layout of the subject Property, the signage being proposed comports with other signage which has been allowed as either a matter of right or by previously issued variances within this district. The signage is screened by buildings to the north, east and west. To the south sight lines are partially obstructed. Stepping further back from the Property, and viewing the proposed signage from the Boston side of the Charles River, it should be noted that based upon a sight walk the sign will not be visible or minimally visible from the Charles River. Therefore the proposed signage would not cause a substantial detriment in that it is less intrusive than signage already existing within the district and does not have any negative impact upon the surrounding environment.","The intent or purpose of the ordinance will not be nullified or substantially derogated from as the signage being proposed is the best and least intrusive means by which signage could be placed on the subject Property, is being done to blend in with other allowed signage within the district, and is not causing any detriment or harm to any of the adjacent properties or within the district.  It should be noted that the Applicant took efforts to ensure that groups and organizations, within the district, as well as adjacent property owners, were notified and given an opportunity to discuss the plans with the Applicant. After meeting with Liza Paden at the City of Cambridge, Cambridge Community Development Department, applicant also reached out to Barbara Broussard and Claire Burchard-O’Hare, to offer to meet with the East Cambridge Planning Team and other organizations; and did in fact meet with Ms. Broussard to review the proposed signage plans and ensure that she had no objections. While Ms. O'Hare did not take the opportunity to meet with the Applicant, at her request, she was sent a set of the drawings for her review and comment. Applicant did not receive any negative feedback from her. For the reasons set forth above as well as those presented in public and at the hearing, Applicant suggests that the requirements for a variance can be established.","The subject Property is uniquely situated such that it faces circumstances which are different from the majority of other land and structures within the zoning district.

Up until a few years ago, the building had a rear, open deck (approximately 15 ft x 10 ft) which provided both units access to outdoor open space and was the rear means of egress from the first floor of their units out to the rear yard. The rear deck when built met the then applicable rear yard set back requirements for the district. Due to shoddy construction and resulting extensive wood rot, the rear deck failed and had to be demolished. Since that time, petitioners have lacked a rear means of egress from their first floor, and have had to appeal to their insurance company to acknowledge that the rear basement entry doors were sufficient for egress purposes. The petitioners have also experienced severe flooding of their basements due to the fact that there is no longer any shelter over the rear stairs which lead from the yard below grade to the basement entryway (approximately 4-5 feet below grade). Petitioners proposal is to rebuild, creating an enclosed porch, two small decks (one for each unit owner), and a rear egress stair from the porch down to the rear yard. An enclosed porch will provide the petitioners some much needed privacy.  The property abuts a parking lot to a City of Cambridge park and pool which is frequented by people at all hours, who are oftentimes quite noisy, smoke cigarettes, drink and throw trash over the fence into the petitioners' yard. A literal enforcement of this Ordinance would result in a denial of the petitioners' application which would in turn result in a substantial hardship. Petitioners would be unable to construct an enclosed porch in order to serve their reasonable needs for privacy, usable recreational space, a rear egress from the main living floor of their homes, and a shelter over the rear basement entryway.","The peitioners' addition will not be detrimental to the public good, as it will result in a minimal addition at the rear of the property which will hardly be seen by neighboring homeowners.  The addition will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it will affect the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to immediate abuttors. And the users of the City of Cambridge park at the rear will enjoy the view of the tastefully designed porch addition.","The relief requested is minimal and will be in keeping with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance to protect the residential use of properties in the District. Petitioners ask that you allow for a modest increase in the gross floor area (of 242 sf.: an 182 sf enclosed porch, and a 60 sf lower level enclosed basement entryway), which results in an overall FAR of 0.50 which, if sited on a 5,000 sf lot, would be allowable as of right. The petitioners also ask that you allow for the addition and the common rear stairs to lie within the rear yard setback, where the rear yard is currently unusable due to the nuisance caused by users of the abutting City of Cambridge park at the rear. Moreover, the overall variance is minimal for the relief sought.","The hardship is owing in part to the size and shape of the lot which is oversized (6,000 sf) thus triggering a larger than usual rear yard setback of 30 feet and a lower than usual floor area ratio maximum (of between 0.35 to 0.50).  The hardship is also owing to the location of the structure on the lot; the house is set almost squarely on the lot: 33 feet from the front lot line and 37.9 feet from the rear lot line, leaving the petitioners with a relatively oversized front yard, and undersized rear yard. Additionally, the fact that the property abuts the City of Cambridge park and the parking lot of the park, and the nuisance caused by the users of the park results in a further unique hardship.  Finally, the faulty construction design of the rear basement entryway, and resulting likelihood of basement flooding, is a further source of financial and emotional hardship for the petitioners.",,,,,,Boston,MA,03/27/2015

The space that is the subject of this special permit application will be used by the Boston Dog Company (hereinafter the ""Company"") for pet care and related services (such as dog day care, dog grooming, dog training and retail sale of pet related products).  The Company will also utilize one garage space at the Premises for dog training, which for the most part will be one on one.","The Company will offer a pick-up and drop-off service for their clients by utilizing a pet taxi to pick up the pets from their homes and to return them once their services are complete.  This will greatly reduce the need for parking on the street.  The Company already uses this service at their other Cambridge location at 535-545 Cambridge Street.  They estimate that in the last three-years the pet taxi service has saved the environment from 389,250,600 grams in 3 years. This is based on the CO2 Emissions from a gallon of gasoline: 8,887 grams CO2 / gallon1 as estimated from the typical passenger vehicle as stated by the Environmental Protection Agency (source http://www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/documents/420f14040.pdf).  For clients that do not utilize the pet taxi, there are also two parking spaces and a garage space at the Premises.  Clients typically park for an average of 3-4 minutes when picking up/dropping off their dogs and virtually all need for parking is for pick up/drop off.   The site is within a 16 minute walk to the Alewife MBTA train station and approximately an 11 minute walk to the Davis Square MBTA train station.  There are also many bus routes available at a bus stop approximately 20 yards away.  The space intended for use by the Company is in keeping with the established neighborhood character as this space was previousl used as a retail store called Childhood Days which sold children's clothing, toys, etc. on consignment.  Also, the Company plans to seek permission to operate a dog product related ""farmer's market"" out of the garage space on weekends.  This is something other businesses in this area do and seems to be well received by the community.","Adjacent uses are similar to this proposal, this will be a continuation of a common land pattern in this neighborhood.","This proposal will advance the objective of the Zoning Ordinance, which is (generally) to promote service of the needs of the community.  The Company has received requests from citizens in this area to open a location to serve their needs.  Thus, it will not impair the integrity of the district, adjoining district or otherwise derogate from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.","In 2014 the City of Cambridge issued 3,205 dog licenses.  The Boston Dog Company already serves some of these owners at their location at 535-545 Cambridge Street and they have received requests from owners for another location in the North Cambridge area.

They are in state of advanced stage of disrepair.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would cause a hardship by preventing reconstruction of the existing non-conforming structure and preventing the petitioner from a reasonable project to bring the structure up to the current building codes and greater compliance with the Zoning Ordinance.,"The petitioner’s proposal closely follows the intent of the Ordinance and brings the locus into greater conformity with existing zoning.  The proposal eliminates the existing nonconforming elements relative to height, floor area ratio (FAR), and parking. Further, the proposed replacement structure increases the overall safety of this and adjacent parcels by creating significant setbacks where none currently exist. Additionally, the project will also maintain the neighborhood business intent of the district by placing the allowed accessory live/work space within the structure close to the street at grade level.",Relief may be granted because the proposal follows the intent and purpose of the ordinance. Congestion on the streets is reduced by the creation of the required off street parking where none currently exists. Fire safety is improved greatly due to substantial increases in side setbacks from abutters which allows compliance with building code separation requirements that the existing structure currently lacks. There is also significant reduction of the existing massing on the land due to the height reduction and the consolidation of the existing two structures into one.  The proposed structure is in compliance with gross square footage limitations where currently they are exceeded.,"The lot is less than 42’ at its narrowest point and is unusually shaped.  It also narrows on one side creating an hourglass-like effect and is angled at both ends.  These features of the lot creates a hardship with respect to meeting the required formula setbacks of the BA-3 zone prescribed by the Ordinance without relief.  Further, the reconstruction seeks to preserve the historical relationship of the existing structure to the street which requires relief from the front yard setback.",The requirements of the Ordinance are met allowing the required parking on the narrow lot while preserving the required open space.,The proposed project replaces a two family structure with a two family structure so will not increase traffic.  The proposed curb cut is adjacent to the neighbors and will in combination provide a better line of sight for the adjacent neighbors driveway located at 39 Pleasant Street.,"The proposed use comports with existing zoning, and is a less intense use than the current structure since the commercial structure is eliminated.","The safety to the surrounding area, as well as the owner-occupant of the parcel, will be significantly increased by allowing a greater line of sight onto Pleasant Street by eliminating the single story commercial structure, which will also allow the adjacent parcel a clear line of sight where none currently exists.",The proposal conforms the intent and purpose of the ordinance much more closely than the existing condition.,Cambridge,MA,06/10/2015

One of the two children's bedrooms at the third floor has a door to access the flat roof over the second floor in the rear, which has a fires escape attached to it for additional egress from the third floor in case of an emergency, but currently there is no railing around the perimeter of the roof at all. The attached neighbor has a wooden deck on the same contiguous roof, proytecting the rubber memberane, and a railing around two sides of it.The neighbor also has an air conditioning condenser on the roof, at the property line where the two residneces attach, and just beyond the wood decking towards the rear. While a by-right deck is possibble, complying with the 7.5' sideyard setbackl in an A-1 district, the space of the allowable deck would be peculiarly narrow and un-usable. A roof with no railing and a fire escpae is unnecessarily dangerous. The Petitioner proposes a deck that abuts and aligns with that of the neighjbor, places a new air conditioning condernser adjacent the neighbor's, and has a railing around it. In making the deck at least 15' wide it also increases open space on the site.

Harvard University seeks a variance to permit the implementation of a comprehensive signage program for the Divinity School campus.  The proposed signage program seeks to establish a more consistent design aesthetic for campus signage and to simplify directional wayfinding for the students, faculty, staff and visitors to the Divinity School campus.  Given the number of campus access points, multiple buildings and street addresses, sufficient signage is necessary in order to adequately identify campus access points and to guide visitors to key campus destinations.  The proposed signage plan includes seven (7) signs which are subject to zoning requirements, consisting of campus identification signs, building identification signs and pedestrian directional signs in the vicinity of Andover and Rockefeller Halls.  The proposed signs have been carefully designed to work well with the architecture of the buildings and neighborhood. Zoning relief is required due to the area, number, and height of signs. As part of the signage program, existing map signs have been refurbished.  Signage which is internal to the campus (not visible from a public way) and signs necessary for public safety and convenience have been certified by the Cambridge Community Development Department as exempt from zoning restrictions.  Because the Divinity School campus is located in Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts, signage for non-residential uses is limited to two non-banner signs per building and a total area of 30 sq. ft. per building.  To adequately serve the identification and wayfinding needs of this multi-building educational campus, a variance is required to permit the area, number, and height of the proposed signs.  The campus has developed over time to include buildings on several streets with multiple access points for persons walking, driving or biking to the campus.  The access points include Francis Avenue, Museum Street, Divinity Avenue, internal pathways and a number of parking facilities.   Due to the nature of the campus, the proposed directional signs are not associated with a building, but rather are designed to guide visitors through the campus to campus buildings.  A literal enforcement of the provisions of the CZO 7.16 would permit a maximum of two signs per building and preclude the Harvard Divinity School from installing adequate signage to effectively provide wayfinding for campus visitors and users.  This limitation would prevent Harvard Divinity School from adequately identifying all entrances and providing clear directional information to key campus buildings on the Divinity School campus.  Such enforcement would create a significant hardship by impacting campus operations (for example the lack of clear identification of locations for receipt of mail and deliveries, and for emergency response).  It would also make wayfinding more difficult for the many visitors to the Divinity School campus including prospective students and their families or for people attending events held on campus.","The requested variance is needed to properly identify the buildings on the Divinity School campus.  Therefore, the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public good. On the contrary, the granting of the variance will in fact be a benefit to the public good, as it will guide visitors to the Divinity School campus.  Given the proximity of the campus to the Shady Hill National Register District, the proposal has been reviewed by the Executive Director of the Cambridge Historic Commission.","The requested variance will allow the placement of campus wayfinding signs to guide visitors to the Divinity School campus, which is consistent with the CZO’s assertion that the public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available. Unlike most buildings in Residence A-2 and C-3 districts, this is an educational institutional facility, and therefore requires visible signage to meet the stated public interest. Thus, granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","The Harvard Divinity School is a multi-building educational campus with buildings fronting on several streets including Divinity Avenue, Museum Street and Francis Avenue.  The campus has multiple access points with visitors arriving on the campus from city streets, nearby parking garage facilities and internal campus pathways.  Buildings have multiple front doors, including those facing the street and those that are internal to the campus.Due to the physical characteristics of the multi-building educational campus, additional signage is needed to identify primary access points and to facilitate visitor wayfinding to key campus buildings.  The need for greater flexibility in the signage permitted for non-residential uses in the Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts is unique to the function of a multi-building educational campus, and is not typical of other uses in the Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,07/01/2015

The 1977 subdivision created an odd configuration of lots, some with zero lot line setbacks.  The Owner wishes to create a more usable and pleasant space for his bedroom.  This modification would not add any additional G.F.A. to the house.  And the Owner has already obtained an as-of-right building permit for the modification of part of this same roof, and obtaining the variance for the remaining part of the roof would simplify the construction process and unify the appearance of the façade.Variance 2: Allow a cantilevered window seat on the east façade to touch the ground in the side setback: A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would not allow this request, as the new window seat, which replaces two smaller window seats from the earlier unit configuration, is inside the required side setback.  Granting this variance would allow the construction to more closely replicate the previous window seats, which did touch the ground, and will provide a more stable structural solution for the seat and wall.  The Owner has already obtained an as-of-right building permit for a cantilevered window seat, and requests that a more reasonable structural solution, by touching the ground, be allowed.Variance 3: Allow a cantilevered fireplace on the east façade to touch the ground in the side setback. For reasons similar to those stated in Variance #2 above, we request the ability to place the base of the (zero clearance, manufactured) fireplace on the ground.  These townhouses are built as a slab on grade, meaning the first floor level is just a few inches above grade.  Cantilevering the fireplace (which is currently permitted) would result in an odd space, perhaps less than 12” in height, from the grade to the underside of the fireplace framing.  It would seem reasonable to place this fireplace on its own secure, but minimal, foundation.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  Variance 1: The proposed modest modification of the roof will not affect the public good at all.Variance 2 and 3: Whether the window seat and the fireplace are cantilevered or touch the ground, there is no detriment to the public good.  Therefore sound and reasonable building practice should dictate that they touch the ground.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its mision, among many things, “…to encourage housing for persons…” and “…to conserve the value of land and buildings…”For all 3 Variance requests, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as these modest requests do not affect the general design of the house or the neighborhood.  In both a general and specific sense, the proposed modifications neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","Variance 1: Raised Eave Height:  The 1977 subdivision created an odd and peculiar set of lot lines, and generated a number of non-conformities, and therefore the hardship.  The modification of this portion of the west eave requires a variance specifically because of the odd shaped lot.  Generally, the C-1 zone does not have such odd subdivisions, and thus granting this variance would not generally affect the zoning district.Variance 2 and 3: Cantilevered window seat and cantilevered fireplace to the ground: as mentioned earlier, the original two adjacent townhouses each had their own window seats which touched the ground.  The merging of the two townhouses into a single home required a new design, and thus the proposed window seat is in a different location than the earlier seats.  The slab-on-grade construction itself generates a hardship, as there is nearly no height difference between the exterior grade and the first floor.  Being forced to cantilever these elements will result in an odd, inaccessible space below the cantilever, inviting weeds and critters.  It would make much greater sense, from a structural and land use perspective, to allow them to touch the ground.","The townhouse development was completed in 1977 and was immediately subdivided into fee simple single family homes.  The resulting subdivision lot lines created many non-conforming conditions which preclude simple modifications to the building.  The lot lines, and the strict interpretation of calculated setback, create areas of the structure that cannot be modified without a Special Permit.  This Special Permit seeks to allow modification of these areas of the building, to more fully integrate this merged unit.",This work will not affect patterns of access or egress or cause any additional congestion.  The merging of two units into one will reduce density in the City.,The proposed modifications do not affect the use or future development of any adjacent uses.,There will be no creation of any nuisance or hazard.,"The proposed modifications will not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district, or derogate from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.",Cambridge,MA,07/01/2015

The Petitioners wish to renovate the Property so as to make it more suitable for their growing family, by infilling a portion of the main house to create an additional bedroom, and building a two-story addition (9.5 ft x 22 ft) out over the paved driveway to provide for a family room. The dwelling was built in 1978 under Article 11 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (Townhouse Development) and is located in a C-1 District, across the street from a Business 1 District. A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would not allow for the renovation and addition which is necessary to allow the Petitioners and their growing family to stay in their home. The Petitioners face a number of design challenges, including the existing interior layout of the home, limited lot area to expand, a rear yard easement and configuration of neighboring homes in the complex. The proposed renovation works within these constraints and addresses the Petitioner's needs for additional living and home office space, and a more efficient, safe and family-friendly interior layout to the home. Further, the need to preserve the existing driveway parking results in the addition being built out over a 209 square foot driveway. This open driveway area under the proposed addition is counted towards the total GFA and FAR calculations even though it does not result in an increase in livable space.","The Petitioner’s proposed renovations and addition will not be detrimental to the public good, as it seeks to reconfigure interior space within the existing building and extend the existing structure out by only 9.5 feet.  The addition will meet the setback requirements on the left/North side of the existing building, and will extend the existing non-conforming rear wall of the structure. The addition, built out over the existing paved parking area, will not impact open usable space or parking. The design of the addition is in keeping with the Bell and Fandetti architectural style. The addition will be largely unseen behind the existing 10 ft. high fence, and will have little to no impact on the light and shadow in the area. The rear courtyard area is largely in shadow throughout much of the day mainly due to the shadows created by the large apartment buildings abutting their Property on Green Street. And thus the proposed addition will not affect the street scape view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it will affect the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to immediate abutters.","The requested Variance will allow for a moderate expansion to a single-family residential dwelling. With minimal impacts to the neighborhood and the District, the proposed modifications to this residential dwelling will allow for a growing family to continue live in the City for years to come. The requested relief can be granted without nullifying or derogating from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.","The hardship is owing to the following circumstances: the undersized lot, the location of the structure on the lot (with a zero lot line to the South), the unusual shape and size of the existing structure (being a relatively low building with an angled roof line, and the unusual interior layout of this Bell and Fandetti townhouse, conditions which do not generally affect other properties in the zoning district. The interior layout contains a series of platforms at different elevations and double height (atrium style) spaces; these spaces are unusable, unsafe for children, and energy inefficient – difficult to heat and cool, resulting in heat/cooling loss.

Project DescriptionHarvard University has a decentralized campus serving the undergraduate college and twelve graduate and professional schools.  To promote a more integrated campus for all members of the Harvard community and visitors, the University is proposing to transform three floors of the Smith Campus Center (SCC) to create a campus center that builds community with an emphasis on connectivity and transparency, and engages the building with Harvard Square.  The SCC aims to provide flexible, accessible and sustainable spaces that permit a wide range of uses including eating, gathering, meeting, studying, performing and exhibiting the arts. The heart of the SCC will include a large, open plan interior “living room,” as a companion to the exterior “living room” of Harvard Yard. It will also establish a welcoming and vibrant entrance to Harvard University for visitors, current and prospective Harvard affiliates, and the Cambridge community.  The project will maintain food services throughout the first floor of the building.  The majority of the first floor and half of the second floor, which house the Welcome Area, Common Spaces and food venues, will be open and available to the public.  The project calls for a transformational improvement of the public realm with enhanced amenities and unique spaces that do not exist elsewhere in Harvard Square.  Given its envisioned role as a campus hub, the SCC is ideally located just steps away from the MBTA station and Harvard Yard in Harvard Square. To achieve this vision for the campus center, Harvard proposes to renovate and selectively reconstruct portions of the SCC building, the former Holyoke Center.  This building was originally constructed in the early 1960’s as a mixed use educational institutional and commercial building and was designed by renowned architect Josep Lluís Sert. The project has been carefully designed to respect Sert’s original planning and design principles relating to connectivity, scale, massing, light, and façade and roofscape. The building is also located in the Harvard Square Conservation District. The project received a Certificate of Appropriateness in April 2015 after the Cambridge Historical Commission determined that a majority of the objectives of the Harvard Square Conservation District are satisfied by the design. (See Appendix for Certificate of Appropriateness.)The existing first and second floors are highly fragmented with limited connectivity between the first floor pavilions and the arcade, between the first and second floor levels, and within the second floor. In light of these limitations of the existing structure, the proposed project will selectively demolish approximately 10,000 square feet and add net new floor area of 7,500 square feet both internal to the building via parking and mechanical space conversions as well as several exterior additions.  The proposed Smith Campus Center project will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance with the exception of the three elements which require zoning relief and are described below.	1.	FAR The existing Smith Campus Center building was built as-of-right beginning in the early 1960’s over two phases and is located in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  The purpose of the Overlay District is to “facilitate the protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area.” (CZO 20.52)Over the years, the building has undergone a number of alterations and small additions, and has previously received zoning relief for FAR. A recent comprehensive analysis of the building indicates that the existing FAR is 4.38, which exceeds the allowable FAR of 4.0 for non-residential uses in the Business B zoning district within the Harvard Square Overlay District (CZO 20.54.6).  To make the campus center program and layout feasible given the physical constraints of the existing building and site, the proposed project requires a slight increase in FAR by 0.1.  This represents 7,512 net new square feet, resulting in an FAR of 4.48, which is a 2% increase in overall GFA from existing. The newly created GFA will be partially offset by new spaces that are exempted from the GFA calculation, such as new mechanical spaces, elevator machinery rooms, and exterior landscape. This 7,512 net new SF is located on several levels of the building:  Floor 10 	554 SFFloor 2/Mezz	5,971 SFFloor 1 		-38 SFBasement 	1,592 SFThe specific program areas that comprise the net new floor area are described in detail below:•	Basement:  Underground Garage Conversion for Support Space:  The basement level, which is a total of approximately 60,524 square feet of gross square footage (GSF), will require a support kitchen for the commercial food venues, support storage, and an elevator shaft space, for a total of 1,592 square feet of newly converted gross floor area (GFA).  Since a significant portion of the basement area does not currently count toward the FAR calculation because of its exempted use as an underground parking facility, the variance request is to convert a small portion of the underground garage into FAR.  This reprogramming of existing space will allow the project to (a) maximize use of the first floor for public uses, (b) create a more efficient kitchen operation that can easily service the food venues above, (c) leverage adjacencies to service ramps, trash rooms, storage, delivery areas, and (d) contain cooking smells.•	Floors 1 and 2:  Welcome Area Pavilion:  An essential component of the SCC program is to create a transparent Welcome Area to Harvard University for visitors and the community.  The location of the Welcome Area is proposed at the front door of the building which is adjacent to the Harvard MBTA station and the Harvard Yard.  At the first and second floors, a new, highly transparent, double height Welcome Area Pavilion addition engages the exterior plaza for better comfort, utility and accessibility and is consistent with Sert’s original design principles. Sert’s pavilion design language is utilized to provide adequate space to meet fundamental visitor and community needs such as an information desk, events information, ticketing services, indoor / outdoor seating, chess program, public restrooms, indoor / outdoor commercial dining, and meeting space.  The proposed design requires the demolition of the first floor greenhouse (945 SF) and the reconstruction of the first and second floor Welcome Area Pavilion. The first floor of the pavilion has approximately 1,000 net new square feet which extends approximately 10’ from the existing greenhouse and allows an integrated, indoor open plan Welcome Area that increases seating to be used for all seasons. The seating can be used by the public and is not limited to food venue customers.  During temperate weather, the transparent first floor sliding doors of the Welcome Pavilion can be opened to integrate indoor with outdoor seating and activities.  The second floor is approximately 2,900 net new square feet which is double height, an important feature of Sert’s design. The new Welcome Area Pavilion aligns with and takes advantage of the existing structure of the underground garage. Without the newly created addition, Harvard would not be able to create a Welcome Area that would adequately serve its visitors and the community.  •	Floors 1, 2 and Mezzanine:  Holyoke Street Pavilion:  Along Holyoke Street, a new pavilion is proposed replacing Sert’s existing pavilion.  The proposed use will be an indoor gathering space – indoor living room that will serve as a social, cultural, and intellectual destination, bringing together members of the community in a space that is publicly accessible.  Sert’s original pavilion is constructed on a site that accommodates a major grade shift between the arcade and the Holyoke Street level.  The original pavilion was designed with a series of fragmented, separate smaller spaces with minimal natural light and no interior connectivity between the spaces and between the arcade and the street.  In addition, the existing rooftop does not have structural capacity to be an interior floor.  In order to achieve the intent of the new program and meet Sert’s design principles, the proposed project demolishes the existing pavilion and reconstructs a transparent pavilion that maximizes natural light and landscape elements (10,496 SF) and includes a small infill addition on the first floor (341 SF).  The central gathering space on the first floor transitions the level difference between the arcade and the street gracefully and visually and physically connects the mezzanine and second floor spaces.  If the existing pavilion is not reconstructed it would not be possible to meet the programmatic requirements and meet Sert’s design principles.•	Floor 2:  Dunster Street Pavilion Roof Terrace:  The proposed SCC project maximizes and improves outdoor space on the first and second floors to create usable gathering space. The Dunster Street Pavilion will transform an existing unoccupied mechanical roofscape into a usable exterior green roof that will be publicly accessible. New GFA (212 SF) is required to create circulation to access that space.  Without the new GFA the proposed exterior green roof could not be accessed by stairs which would not provide adequate egress.•	Floor 10:  Projecting Bay:  The tenth floor program calls for a small but highly transparent projecting bay (116 SF) that will create a new beacon and focal point at the roofline of the building, converted from a portion of an existing roof terrace (that counts towards existing GFA).  Used as an event space that will be an active and animated use, the projecting bay signals a civic gesture to the broader community.•	Floor 10:  Mechanical Conversion to Program Space:  Existing mechanical space within the building that is no longer required due to more efficient systems will be converted to usable program space for the campus center meeting and events space (438 SF).A literal enforcement of the provisions will prevent the campus center from meeting the critical programmatic and layout requirements that will serve the Harvard and Cambridge community and from establishing comprehensive circulation and accessibility paths through the building.2.	Height At the time of the original construction, the allowed height in the Business B district was 100 feet plus a one-story penthouse. As designed and built, the first nine floors of the Smith Campus Center building were 97’, and the tenth floor was considered a 15’ penthouse for a total building height of 112’.  In 1979, new height restrictions as established by the creation of the Harvard Square Overlay District made Smith Campus Center nonconforming for height.  As envisioned by the proposed project, the tenth floor on the Massachusetts Avenue frontage will have a new highly transparent projecting bay as part of a series of meeting and event spaces. The projecting bay, constructed within the existing eastern terrace, will signal the new use and forms a compositional relationship with Sert’s existing roof monitors and the new Welcome Area Pavilion.  The projecting glazed volume at the tenth floor is 3’-11” taller than the existing 112’-1” roofline to 116’.  This slight height increase is very limited in size, comprising only one room 23’-6” in façade length and representing approximately 600 square feet, 2% of the total roof area. The requested increase will be set in the context of a roof with many other taller elements including three stair towers at 125’-9”, a cooling tower and two mechanical rooms at 130’, and two elevator machine rooms, one at 131’ and the other at 154’.  The proposed increase will have no shadow impact and will subtly add visibility of the building form from view-points north of Harvard Square, Massachusetts Avenue at Cambridge Common, the Science Center, and Harvard Yard.  The overall transparent bay will serve as a civic gesture to Harvard Square, a contemporary expression similar in nature to the historic bell towers, cupolas, and steeples that currently punctuate the Harvard Square skyline.A literal enforcement of the provisions will require the projecting bay to remain at the 112’ height which would diminish the visual impact of the rooftop beacon in Harvard Square.3.	NonconformityThe Smith Campus Center is considered to be nonconforming with respect to FAR, height, parking, and loading. As a result of the proposed FAR and height variance requests, it is also necessary that the project seek zoning relief to allow a legally nonconforming structure to be altered and expanded by 2% from existing.  As provided in the State General Laws (Section 6, Ch. 40A), the CZO permits the change, extension, or alteration of a pre-existing nonconforming structure or use as outlined in Article 8.000 so long as the change, extension, or alteration will not be “substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure or use.” (CZO 8.22). This project has been designed to be sensitive to the building’s original design principles and consistent with the Harvard Square Conservation District objectives and will provide a significant number of public benefits.","The requested relief enables a transformational improvement of the public realm at this site. In response to feedback garnered at a number of public forums including the City of Cambridge’s Harvard Square Placemaking workshops, community open houses, and from the Harvard Square Business Association and Harvard affiliates, the Smith Campus Center program and design have been tailored to ensure that the building engages the vibrancy of Harvard Square and meets the needs of Harvard affiliates, visitors, and the Cambridge community.  The project calls for improved and expanded seating areas, food venues, and visitor services that are welcoming to all. The areas of the building available and open to the public will significantly increase through this project. Forbes Plaza will be redesigned to include comfortable seating, chess tables, and new plantings that are inviting and allow for flexible outdoor usage for performances and public art. The new transparent Welcome Area pavilion includes seating areas on the first and second floors with views of Harvard Square and Forbes Plaza for full-year enjoyment. The redesigned Mount Auburn Plaza calls for a lush grove of trees to create a more contemplative plaza with seating, chess tables, and more legible and improved site circulation.  Dunster Street will be lined with eateries and outdoor dining, with a second floor roof garden overlooking the street for a unique Harvard Square experience that can be enjoyed by the public.  The Holyoke Street Pavilion will house food venues and event space, which will create an active street front. Services and amenities will be enhanced including information and ticketing on events and activities at Harvard University, and bike parking. The number of public restrooms will increase and will be relocated to a more convenient location. The sustainable design approach includes green roofs and green walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden within the arcade, and healthy building materials. The project creates no detriment to the public good in terms of traffic impact as it will serve the same Harvard affiliate and visitor population as it does today in a location that is highly pedestrian-oriented and transit accessible. Harvard undertook a voluntary traffic study that validates that the project will have no adverse traffic impacts and has reviewed the project with the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.The small height increase (for a 600 square foot room with a highly transparent projecting bay) will be only 3’-11” taller than the existing roofline. The small increase will be set in the context of a roof with many other taller elements including three stair towers at 125’-9”, a cooling tower and two mechanical rooms at 130’, and two elevator machine rooms, one at 131’ and the other at 154’.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The Smith Campus Center project will not create any significant detriment to Harvard Square. The project calls for a continuation of the building’s institutional and commercial uses. It will continue to serve the Harvard University population, visitors, and the Cambridge community as it does today during the same general time frame from early morning to late at night. The proposed project calls for no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide significant public benefits. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the significant improvement of the functionality and operation of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center and its public amenity to Harvard Square.","Topographical changes around the large site resulted in the existing building design having various ground floor levels that do not align or connect, creating barriers to accessibility, permeability, and the creation of larger consolidated spaces. The second floor rooftop does not have structural capacity to serve as an interior floor.  The current configuration of the central arcade and the retail spaces along Holyoke Street conflicts with the proposed Holyoke Street section and façade arrangement. To overcome the incompatible floor level and structural conditions, this pavilion will be reconstructed with a new second floor, resulting in an open plan layout which is fully permeable, accessible, and allows a continuous floor plate for larger gatherings and events.  The unique location of the site at the heart of Harvard Square and Harvard University creates a need to accommodate and orient the many visitors to Harvard Square and the University as well as University affiliates and the Cambridge community.  The comfort facilities and other amenities of the Welcome Area require space in the front part of the building where most visitors arrive, closest to Harvard Yard and the MBTA station. Additional GFA is required because the existing building layout creates barriers to expansion within the building. The vehicular ramps to the basement are located directly south of the proposed Welcome Area, creating a barrier to physical expansion southward. The ramps must be maintained for parking and servicing of the building. The adjacent arcade also must be maintained as a critical circulation pathway. Sert’s iconic design for the existing structure also constrains the design of the renovations. The project, and in particular the two-story Welcome Pavilion and the tenth floor bay, has been designed to create quality space while respecting Sert’s original planning and design principles relating to connectivity, scale, massing, light, and façade and roofscape.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,11/06/2015

While my business technically does not quality as manufacturing, products will be produced on a small scale and packaged on site for retail and wholesale.  Condition 1:  ""Provided that at least fifty (50) percent of such merchandise is sold at retail on the premises""  While it is very difficult to predict precise sales figures, the intended scope of the wholesaling aspect of my business is rather small. I expect to do roughly 25-35% of my business via wholesaling to area business in the first year or two at 2257.  However, as my customer base grows I hope to reduce wholesaling.Condition 2: ""and that all display and sales are conducted within a building"" Due to the storage needs of sweets and baked goods all sales would be conducted inside the building.  The heat and cold the products would be subjected to on the sidewalk would not only impair the products but would obstruct foot traffic as well.  For these reasons, all sales would take place indoors.","Traffic to the area would not be any different than if a non-food retail shop, or restaurant would occupy 2257.  Because there would be no alterations to the existing road infrastructure, or the building itself, traffic will essentially be unaffected.","The building itself will not be altered (other than the required ventilation) and would therefore not hinder the other businesses on the block in any way.  Furthermore, I would not be in direct competition with any other businesses in the area, as there are no confectioneries (artisanal or otherwise) in the immediate vicinity.  On the contrary, I have only encountered support thus far from area businesses, as evidenced by the letters attached to this application.","The operation of Spindler Confections at 2257 would cause no noise, odors, fumes, or other hazards detrimental to the occupants or citizens of the area.  No machinery is used in the process (thus eliminating the possibility of noise), and everything is made, cut, wrapped, and packaged by hand.  For further evidence of this I would like the Board to note that I have been operating out of my home for the last three years in Somerville and have never had any complaints.  As far as I can tell, most of my neighbors don’t even know that a business operates there.","Though it has elements of three different uses, the operation is not really any different than a bakery, retail shop, or restaurant, other than the aspect of wholesaling.  We cannot think of any reason why our operation at 2257 would impair the integrity of the district.  The wholesale aspect is so small that all deliveries are made in the owner's personal vehicle and the frequenty of deliveries is generally once a month (escept during the holiday season).",Somerville,MA,08/19/2015

In 1998, HDS received the Board of Zoning Appeal approval for an addition to Andover Hall, which included construction of the cloister link located between the original Andover Hall and the Library. This narrow and subdivided addition was designed to serve primarily as offices. These interconnected structures, which are considered one building for the purposes of zoning, contain approximately 89,893 square feet of GFA and are together referred to as “the Building” or “Andover Hall”.  The Building is located entirely within a Residence A-2 zoning district and the Harvard-Radcliffe-Lesley Institutional Overlay District.  The institutional lot in which the Building is located is bisected by a zoning boundary between the Residence A-2 and Residence C-3 zoning districts.  The majority of the lot is located within the Residence C-3 zone.  The existing Building together with the other buildings on the lot, exceeds the allowable floor area ratio (FAR) of the Residence A-2 zone.  The proposed project involves the renovation of the existing building which is permitted as-of-right; the removal of the 2001 addition (4,051 square feet) and its replacement with a two-story newly constructed addition of 9,594 square feet, in addition to other minor GFA adjustments in the building. Overall the proposed project will result in a net increase of 3,279 square feet of GFA to the Building. Harvard Divinity School (“HDS”) was founded in 1816 and serves nearly 300 graduate students in four degree programs.  Its mission is to educate students of religion for intellectual leadership, professional service, and ministry. Andover Hall, the principal and signature building of the Harvard Divinity School campus, serves as its center of teaching and student life.  Andover Hall was designed and built in 1911 to support a turn-of-the-century divinity curriculum, and it has never been renovated comprehensively since original construction.  In 1935 the study of religion at the Harvard Divinity School was mostly a private, scholarly matter between professor and student. Its spaces were not designed to accommodate collaborative work, colloquia that would exceed a small number of people, or twenty-first century technology. A century ago, HDS was also centered primarily on one set of Western, religiously observant assumptions about the nature of religion and the world. In this century, the study of religion at HDS incorporates multiple faith traditions and requires extended interactions among larger groups of people and extending invitations to people from outside the walls of academia to bring their perspectives to the work. Without these kinds of interactions, HDS cannot adequately prepare its students for their future work on the worlds of ministry, social justice and social leadership.HDS has multiple unmet programmatic needs on its campus in light of contemporary educational needs and the evolution of the academic mission of the School in a modern, inclusive, multi-faith world. In particular, HDS’s needs include a larger convening space, student life space and additional instructional spaces. These programmatic needs are integral to the academic mission and must be met within Andover Hall, which has been the heart of teaching and student life at HDS since 1935. The project intent is to strengthen the academic and social core of the school, which takes place in Andover Hall. The required program adjacencies for teaching and student life can only be met in Andover, which include worship space, student life, teaching spaces, convening spaces, library, and the cafe. Since the HDS campus is at an edge location, it is at a distance from other Harvard student life amenities, making these elements more important. Additionally, the HDS population is a fairly small community of scholars that needs its own spaces to strengthen its program, so it is not dispersed.The key goals of the proposed project at Andover Hall are to create modernized and enhanced learning and student life spaces to meet contemporary educational needs, to address the building’s deferred maintenance requirements, and to improve the building’s energy efficiency and sustainability. The overall renovation of Andover Hall will renovate existing and add new classrooms, meeting rooms, and common spaces with food service; restore and upgrade the building envelope; achieve full compliance with current building, life safety, accessibility code requirements; replace or upgrade building systems; and upgrade the building’s energy efficiency and sustainability. To facilitate the project, HDS is planning to free up approximately 16,000 square feet of space within the building by moving some library collections off-site, introducing new compact shelving for other parts of the library collections, and utilizing more efficient building systems.The proposed renovation and expansion will replace the existing cloister link with a two-story addition containing a student common space on the ground level and a large multi-purpose classroom and 200-seat convening space at the first level to accommodate symposia and speakers.  Additionally, the South Wing of Andover Hall will have an internal reconfiguration, resulting in the loss of a mezzanine floor, and the gain of a new multi-faith worship space on the second floor, all within the existing building envelope. Finally, the installation of more efficient building systems allows some existing mechanical space to be repurposed for student life office space, also within the existing building envelope. In total the GFA will increase by 3,279 square feet as a result of the project.A literal enforcement of the provisions of the CZO 5.31 Table 5-1 and CZO 8.22.3 would preclude the Harvard Divinity School from creating a new central campus space for large gatherings, student life, collaborative work and multi-faith worship. This limitation would prevent Harvard Divinity School from adequately serving its students, faculty and staff and achieving its academic mission. Such enforcement would create a significant hardship by impacting opportunities for teaching, learning, and collaboration.","The requested variance will allow the Harvard Divinity School to meet its educational mission within its core campus, at a distance from the adjacent residential neighborhood that will not be detrimental to the public good.  The granting of the variance will in fact be a benefit to the public good by investing in the historic resources of Cambridge, creating new and improved teaching and learning spaces that will be enjoyed by the public, improving the building’s life safety, accessibility to persons with disabilities, and enhancing the campus landscape with new plantings, which will be continue to be an open space enjoyed by the neighboring community. The project will include innovative sustainability features including smart ventilation, heat recovery, water conservation, improved energy efficiency, and healthy building materials such as carpeting, paint, and furniture. Improvements to the landscape will reduce water use with smart irrigation and drought resistant plantings in a greenspace design that builds on HDS’s vision for its campus green first implemented a decade ago. The project will target LEED Gold certification resulting in a more energy efficient building.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The proposed addition to Andover Hall can be readily accommodated on the site in a manner that does not impact the overall physical character of the lot or the surrounding neighborhood. The proposed addition would be a sensitively scaled infill in an area between the original Andover Hall and the Library and is interior to the campus and only minimally visible from the closest public way.  The proposed project will result in no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide public benefits of improved accessibility and life safety, and sustainable building means and methods. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the preservation of the nonconforming historic structure, while significantly improving its life safety, accessibility, and its ability to meet the educational mission.","The size, configuration, and structural system of the existing cloister link or the larger Andover Hall is inherently not able to meet the current space needs for an open, flexible, and slightly larger footprint that these programs require. The 1911 Andover Hall was designed by Allen and Collens, a firm specializing in ecclesiastical and neo-medieval designs, and commissioned by its original owner, the Andover Theological Seminary. Acquired by Harvard in 1935, it is the only example of the Collegiate Gothic architectural style on the Harvard University campus. The building is constructed of gray granite and presents a highly symmetrical main façade with a central tower and pointed arched windows. The building’s interiors are highly subdivided and designed in a Gothic style which includes ornate carved millwork, exposed wooden beams, vaulted ceilings, and ecclesiastical features including altars and stained-glass windows. These spaces are inherently significant, inflexible, and are difficult to adapt to today’s needs. HDS is intent on preserving the integrity of this historic building and ensuring that any alterations do not diminish its architectural significance, which is a major constraining factor in siting a building expansion.The hardship is also attributable to the specific location of the Building in relation to other structures and to the access driveway into Harvard’s north campus. Andover Hall is the main academic facility of the Harvard Divinity School and is located at the edge of the Harvard University campus, in close proximity to the five other building comprising HDS. Situating the proposed addition away from Andover Hall would isolate essential instructional, convening, and student life functions from the core of the Divinity School campus. Any addition to Andover must be sensitively sited to respect the historic building and to not obstruct the fire lane / service driveway immediately to the south of Andover Hall. Any additions to the west or north of the library would be highly problematic as it would disrupt the library, which is a contained program with sensitive security and circulation implications and would require a larger addition as it would require extra building core space and would not leverage the freed up space in the South Wing. In addition, such west / north additions would result in loss of valuable open space and multiple trees, would create obstructions to important campus pathways, and would encroach on the campus green that is the site for Commencement and other annual events. The proposed site of the Andover Hall addition will ensure that these important schools functions are central to the academic life of the school and are sensitive to the essential needs of the historic building and the campus. The proposed addition will be situated in the north-facing notch between the original Andover Hall and the Library in the general location of the existing cloister link addition. This location allows for the most effective utilization of space, taking advantage of the freed up library stack space and the opportunity to replace the small cloister link addition, which is unremarkable. The proposed location of the addition, surrounded on three sides by existing buildings, will not encroach on the adjacent residential neighborhood. The modest addition will not be visible from Francis Avenue at all.  From Museum Street, it will be set back more than 250 feet from the property line across and visible only at a distance across the landscaped campus green.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,05/29/2019

The Cambridge Planning Board, Community Development Department, and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department recommended alterations to the site to enhance vehicle and pedestrian safety, improve streetfront views through landscaping, and allow for sustainable transportation options on site. The proposed plan reflects those changes through the reconfiguration of the existing non-conforming lot to locate two (2) on grade open parking spaces within five (5) feet of the side and rear property lines, but no closer than those previously existing nonconforming spaces.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,05/31/2019

The enlarged porch roof will increase by one foot the existing non-conforming side yard setback.  The two proposed new dormers will increase the non-conforming total lineal footage of dormers from 34 to 43 lineal feet. These modifications, although very small dimensionally, are required to successfully renovate the property. Therefore a literal enforcement of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship.","No detriment to the public good is seen as a result of the proposed improvements. The project is extremely modest in scope for such a large property, and will result in only 29 additional square feet, a .004 increase in FAR.","The proposed improvements are architecturally compatible with the existing structure and the neighborhood. These modest improvements will allow the house to be renovated and converted back to being a single-family residence, as it was originally. 1)	An outside stair, from ground level to the third floor, was constructed around 1970 and enclosed in 1998. This stair will be eliminated, and the original internal stair from the second to the third floor will be restored. Modifying the stairwell addition by filling in the small triangles and raising the roof to match the existing roof level will allow the stair to be converted to living space. It will also eliminate the awkward existing condition of the stair tower wall where it meets the house wall at a very sharp angle, which presents maintenance difficulties, and a dangerous ice condition in the winter. Filling in two triangles on the second floor and two on the third floor will add 12 square feet. The new roof will be the same height as the existing non-conforming roof (approx 37 feet).2)	A new mudroom and entry door at the first floor level of the former stair tower will be accessed from a porch with a new roof to replace the existing roof, with the depth of the roof increased from 3 feet to 4 feet to provide convenient and safe access. The existing non-conforming yard setback at this location will change from 8.4 feet to 7.4 feet due to the increased width of the porch roof. The new roof will be 8 square feet larger than the existing roof. 3)	Proposed improvements include two new third floor dormers. One of the new third floor dormers will allow for the installation of a new elevator, which will facilitate long-term occupancy for the owners (“aging in place”). The other new dormer will provide a second window for the bedroom, matching the existing windows in the adjacent bedroom. The eight existing dormers comprise 34 lineal feet, and the two proposed dormers will add 9 lineal feet (Ordinance limit is 15 lineal feet). As these dormers are situated in a large mansard roof, and are distributed on all four sides of the roof, the architectural design intent of the Dormer Guidelines will be met. 4)	It is also proposed to relocate three existing third floor dormers, which will not change the FAR. One of these dormers, on the Acacia Street side, will be located within the required front yard setback, but faces a street and therefore does not require relief.The pedestrian traffic and patterns of access and egress will be essentially unchanged. The principal façade of the house on Ash Street will not be changed. The proposed improvements will not cause a congestion hazard, or a change in the character of the neighborhood. The proposed work will have no adverse affect of the adjacent uses, and will not result in the creation of any nuisance or hazard. The proposed improvements are generally in keeping with properties in the neighborhood, and therefore would not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining districts, nor would they derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance. The Owners respectfully submit that this variance may be granted without compromising the purpose of the Ordinance as stated in Article 1, Section 30.","A Variance is requested due to the hardship created by the existing circumstances relating to the shape and topography of the land and structures with regard to required FAR, front and side yard setbacks, height, and dormers, particularly affecting this property.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,08/04/2014

The change of use from a restaurant to auto repair will not be a deteriment to the public interest because the proposed use exists in the immediate adjacent parcels.    The change of use to auto repair will improve the traffic impact on the neighborhood because the applicant owns the business adjactent to the property.   Due to the deteriorated condition of the roof of the existing structure, the Applicant needs to replace the roof.  In replacing the roof, the applicant would like to increase the height of the roof  so as to better accomodate the change of use to auto repair.  A minor increase in the height of the roof to 16 fee will allow the applicant to better ulitize the repairs that will be created within the existing structure.   The Zoning Ordinance alls a nonconforming structure to be altered so long as the alterations does not further violated the dimensional and parking requirments and the volume of the building is not increased more than 25 percent.  Pursuant to Section 8.22.2, the applicant seeks to increase the height of the roof from 12 feet 10 inches to 16 feet.   The 3 foot 9 inch change in the height of the roof is within the 25% change permitted by Section 8.22.2.","The subject site has been a restaurant in the past and the proposal will significantly reduce the vehicular traffic to the site because of the utilization of the existing abutting business as the primary means of access and egress to the site.  The applicant owns the business located at 317 and 325 Fresh Pond Parkway and as a result, the primary means of access to the subject property will be from 317 Fresh Pond Parkway so as to limit vehicles using Vassal Lane.   The applicant will create garage bay doors on the sides of the two adjacent buidlings so that the vehicles can be driven the through auto repair garage into the subject property.   By creating the access between the two buildings, customers will not be utilizing the entrance to the subject property on Vassel Lane.   Customers will access the business from 317 and 325 Fresh Pond Parkway and the applicant's employees will be driving the vehicles inside of the garages.  As a result of the change of use and the applicant's ownership of the adjacent parcel, the vehicles accessing Vassel Lane is reduced significantly. The change in the height of the building will not have an adverse impact on the traffic.",The abutting use is an auto repair garage that currently accomodates the auto repair business that will be expanded to use the subject site.  The Tobin School parking lot and driveway immediately abut the rear.  The rear of the subject property will be fenced so that this will be no impact on the school's driveway and parking lot. The change in the height of the roof will not adversely impact the school.   The removal of the signage from the existing building will result in a lower overall profile of the building as the change in height of the roof will be lower than existing sign.   The appearance of the building will be improved so as to match the adjactent structure.,"All saftey, health and evinronmental regualtions will be addressed in the operation of the auto repair garage.  The garage will operate with the doors closed except for accessing the garages.",This auto repair garage does and will provide valuable service to the city residents in an area that traditionally has such uses.   The current building has not been cared for and has become run down prior to the applicant's ownership.  The site will be visually improved in a manner consistent with the objects of the district.

The plans involve the following, each requiring a variance from Article 5.000 dimensional standards: (A) moving the 2nd apartment’s front entry door to the garden level to be accessed via stairs down to a sunken patio and entryway, and constructing a window well for the garden level apartment bedroom (for light and emergency egress) within the front yard setback; (B) creating a rear egress hallway for the garden level apartment and other minor alterations to porch overhangs result in an increase of 38 square feet of Gross Floor Area; and(C) relocating the parking area, which is currently undersized and located in the front yard setback, to a conforming-sized parking area in an improved location but still located within the front yard setback. The pre-existing, non-conforming parking space (shown as “patio/parking” on the survey plan) has been used by the prior owners for the past 85 years. (See Affidavit of Patricia A. DeCaprio, the previous owner, whose family had owned the Property for approximately 85 years and openly parked in this area throughout this time).  The parking space is undersized, even for a small compact vehicle, resulting in parked cars partially intruding onto the private way.  The Petitioner seeks to relocate the parking space, creating a compliant-sized parking space with permeable materials, resulting in a parking area that is more compliant although still located within front yard setback.  In order to minimize impacts to abutters and create more privacy in their backyard, the Petitioners will install a fence with sliding gate for access to the relocated parking space. To locate the parking further back (as the ordinance would require) would result in even less usable yard area, with little benefit to the neighbors along Athens Terrace. An additional aspect of the work -- constructing stairs and a head house to access new mechanical systems on the roof and a 10 x 20 ft roof deck (not counted towards Gross Floor Area) – should not require a variance because: 1) the stair head house is exempt from calculations of height under Section 5.23 as a “necessary feature appurtenant to buildings which are usually carried above roofs and are not used for human occupancy”, or 2) even if not exempt under Section 5.23, the height of the building with head house will be 35 ft, complying with height requirement for the district.  Note: area within the head house is not included in Gross Floor Area (see definition of “Gross Floor Area shall not include” subsection 7.   HARDSHIP:A literal enforcement of the ordinance impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from renovating this two-family home which is in substantial need of repair, and create a comfortable home for their family while maintaining a 2nd rental apartment on the garden level.  The Petitioner has explored numerous alternatives each of which result in various dimensional non-conformities of varying degrees.  The plans presented to the BZA with this application represent the Petitioner’s best effort to make changes necessary to achieve their desired continued use of this two-family home with minimal zoning relief requested.  The relocation of the front entry and rear egress to the 2nd apartment each result in changes that require zoning relief.  The front entry changes necessitate retaining walls and window wells that Inspectional Services has indicated are deemed to be structures which will be located within the front yard setback, thus requiring a variance.  The new rear egress from the 2nd apartment  requires the relocation of the parking to a location further from the house.  The stair head house on the roof will make access to roof mechanical systems safer and easier, and will allow access to an otherwise zoning compliant roof deck (which will make up for the loss of usable open space in the yard).","Variance relief from Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good.  The renovations to the building will be a vast improvement to the current dilapidated condition, modifications to the exterior will not result in any additions or expansion of the exterior footprint of the building.  Window wells and sunken entrance to the garden level apartment on Athens St. will be below grade and obscured from the road by landscaping, an improvement over the current conditions. The increased GFA will not be seen or have any impact on density or uses within the building.  Finally, the relocated parking area will also be an improvement for the Petitioner and future residents as well as abutters along Athens Terrace, a private way. The current small parking space situation results in owners with a larger vehicle unable to use the parking space, and thus parking along Athens Terrace (a one way, private way, that the City Fire Dept. prohibits parking on the opposite side).  By relocating and increasing the size of the parking space on the Property, and with the new entry location, abutters on Athens Terrace may have an additional space to park along the private way. There will be no adverse impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In fact, the changes to parking will improve these conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioner is able to park on their Property (and not on the private way).  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to proceed with plans to rehabilitate this Property and allow for them to make this their home, while preserving a much-needed rental apartment for the neighborhood.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.•	Preserve much-needed rental housing in an area of Cambridge in great need of such housing.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the structure’s interior configuration of the apartments, aged condition and need for significant rehabilitation, the siting of the structure on this undersized, narrow lot which is located on a corner of a private way with difficult access in for parking.  These unique circumstances collectively result in the Petitioner requiring zoning relief in order to make even modest improvements to the Property.",,,,,,Boston,MA,05/31/2019

However the specific rafter framing of the house, which has “clipped” ceilings on the 2nd floor, suggests a more efficient way to achieve the framing by allowing the addition to encroach on the side setback.  Having to push the addition over by only less than 9” (7.5’ required SB  – 6.8’ proposed SB = 0.7’ = <9”) would create a hardship by complicating the rebuilding of the addition, and having to shift the ridge of the house over an awkward amount.

Variance 2: The >25% addition to the house will still result in a house that is less that the allowable GFA for this property.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its mission, among many things, “…to encourage housing for persons…” and “…to conserve the value of land and buildings…”For both Variance requests, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as these modest requests positively affect the design of the house, but do not detract from the overall design of the neighborhood.  In both a general and specific sense, the proposed modifications neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","Variance 1: Non-Conforming Addition:  As described above, the particular framing of the existing house rafters, with “clipped” ceiling in the 2nd floor bedrooms, suggests that the most efficient way to extend the house, would be to extend the ridge directly, thus simplifying the roof planes.  The house, built in 1890, was located close to the side property line, such that the proposed framing of a new addition would encroach by less than 9” on the side property line.  This modest request is reasonable given the benefits and cost savings of a simplified construction process.Variance 2: >25% addition to a non-conforming structure:  the existing house, even with the awkwardly placed and poorly laid out existing rear addition, has only 1,690 SF of GFA.  Removal of this tail results in an even more modest 1,419 SF.  The proposed additions will create much needed space, and will reorganize the space for a more efficient use.

The dormer (by increasing the headroom in the 15 feet wide area under the dormer) will result in a 65 square feet (SF) increase in the Gross Floor Area (GFA), representing a 2% increase in total GFA in the building. This pre-existing, non-conforming dwelling exceeds the maximum allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.50 for this Residence B District (see Section 5.31 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (the “Ordinance”)); and thus, even this modest 65 SF increase in GFA results in an increase in FAR (from 0.715 (existing) to 0.730 (proposed)) requiring a variance pursuant to Section 8.22.3 of the Ordinance.In all other respects, the proposed renovations will meet the Ordinance requirements, specifically the Dimensional Requirements of Section 5.31 of the Ordinance.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would prevent the Petitioners from being able to effectively use the third floor (second floor of Apt. 2) as livable space due to the inadequate headroom. The house is in need of significant repairs, with the second/third floor apartment (Apt. 2) in greatest need of repair. The intent is to renovate so that Apt. 2 is up to modern standards and suitable for family living. There are no lesser intrusive alternatives that will provide the necessary improvements to the property.","Both the dormer addition and a proposed open deck on the rear of the building meet requirements as to minimum setbacks and do not otherwise result in an increase in the nonconformity of the building. Further, the dormer addition will meet the City of Cambridge Design Guidelines for Roof Dormers.  The dormer addition will be located on the side of the house which faces the end of this dead end private way, and looks out onto a large, open lawn of the abutting property.  The requested relief will not result in a substantial detrimental to the public good.  The proposed dormer addition will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it impair the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor interfere with light and air to immediate abutters.  It will hardly be visible from Wilson Avenue, and will be seen from a significant distance away from Rindge Avenue (see attached photographs from various vantage points). Further, the dormer addition is consistent with similar dormer additions in the immediate neighborhood (see attached photographs of dormer additions within the surrounding 0.5 mile radius).","The Petitioners seek to improve the property, while preserving the look and feel of the original 19th Century home, while rendering it more usable for modern living.  The variance sought is minimal, requesting a very modest increase in FAR, in keeping with the size and massing of the residential homes in the neighborhood, many of which also exceed the Ordinance FAR requirements.  The proposed renovations will not result in overcrowding or increased density (as they will actually reduce the bedroom count), nor create any negative impacts such as increased traffic or dangerous conditions.  And in granting the variance, the Board will support (and not derogate from) the Ordinance’s purposes, to allow for upgrading of the City’s housing stock in a manner consistent with, and supportive of the existing neighborhood.  For the reasons set out above, the Petitioner respectfully request that the Board approve the petition for a Variance.","The existing structure is non-conforming in that it exceeds the maximum Floor Area Ratio for a Residence B District, does not meet front or side setbacks, and is sited on an under-sized (4,396 SF), and somewhat narrow (45 ft. wide) lot.  The roof has a very steep pitch, resulting in extremely limited headroom in the third floor level.  The hardship is owing to the size and unique shape of the building (with its steeply pitched roof), and its location on an undersized, narrow lot.",,,,,,Boston,MA,10/21/2015

Further the property has significant foundational issues and when complete with be a vast improvement to the neighborhood.,The requested relief will not substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the ordinance as the relief is modest in nature and will provide 3rd floor living space and functionality as well as reducing the unit count from four (4) to three (3) units.,The Hardship is owing to the non-conforming size and shape of the lot and structure thereon resulting in a mostly nonfunctional living space on the third floors.

The Appellant and Owner of the house wishes to create a full 2nd story to the house, where only compromised headheight space currently existg.It was originally considered that this modification to the building would be allowed as-of-right under C.Z.O. 8.22.1.H.1.  While this section of the Ordinance does not specifically preclude the creation of a 2nd story addition as we have planned it, it is not the practice of the Zoning Department to grant such exceptions.  Therefore we are applying for the variance as follows:A literal enforcement of the ordinance would not allow for the addition of the 2nd story as we have proposed it.  The existing house already has a 2nd floor, but this floor has compromised headheight in the main section of the building, and a nearly unusable headheight in the tail of the building.  This house has been in the family for generations, and the family has lived in the neighborhood beyond that.  The current owner, the grandson of the original owner, wishes to make a home for himself and his eventual family.  Not being able to make a full 2nd floor will considerably limit his options of staying in Cambridge.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  To the contrary, the correction of this situation provides a significantly higher level of habitability, encouraging a family to settle in this area.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its mission, among many things, to “…to encourage housing for persons of all income levels…”.  For this Variance request, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as this modest request positively affects the habitability of the structure.In both a general and specific sense, the proposed modifications neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","The hardship is owing to the configuration of the structures on the lot, and the size of the lot itself.  This lot is narrow, and therefore nearly any modifications to the house would run into issues with the Ordinance.  The house, too, because of the narrow lot, was built only 1.9’ from the left property line, which creates the non-conformity.Granting this reasonable request for zoning relief will not affect the zoning district in which the structures are located.","1.	The house at 52 Union Street was built in 1873 (according to the Cambreidge Assesor’s Database), and was constructed on a small and narrow lot.  See site plan.  2.	The proposed additions to the existing strucrure do not enlarge the footprint of the house.  The renovated structure wishes to take advantage of the views to the rear yard.  3.	A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would not allow for changes to window openings in this rear façade as this façade is within the required rear setback for the C-1 zone.4.	As the footprint of the house is not changing, this is a modest request.",This work will not affect patterns of access or egress or cause any additional congestion.,The proposed modifications do not affect the use or future development of any adjacent uses.,There will be no creation of any nuisance or hazard.,"The proposed modifications will not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district, or derogate from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.",Cambridge,MA,01/14/2016

Due to the fact that this home is located at the far rear portion of this deep and narrow lot in violation of current setback requirements of the Ordinance, any window or door changes on the rear or side of the house require special permit relief.  Specific changes requiring relief includes the following:At the rear of the house: relocating three windows on the first floor rear wall (shifting locations of existing windows by inches); relocating and enlarging three windows on the second floor rear wall (to allow light and air to second floor stairway/hallway and bathroom); and adding a small window on the rear first floor (kitchen) and a new window on the second floor (son’s bedroom).At the right side of the house: enlarging windows and constructing egress doors to the side patio. Construction will otherwise comply with other dimensional requirements of the Ordinance.","The proposed construction will not result in additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character.  The window and door modifications will be consistent with the style of other residential structures in the neighborhood. These changes will allow for much needed improvements within this single-family home, and will be very much in keeping with the historic character of the home and the residential neighborhood.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed renovations of the house.  This will continue to be used as a single-family residential home, and modifications will not result in adverse impacts on the neighboring residential uses.  Relocated, enlarged and new windows and doors will have minimal impacts on neighbors due to their location and the limited views from the neighboring properties at the rear and right side of the house.  It should be noted that three of the windows at the new second floor dormer level will be windows from a stairwell/hallway (to provide light and air to second floor of the home) and a bathroom; and the fourth window at that level will replace the smaller window in the bedroom.  Relocated windows will be shifted by inches, resulting in minor changes not impacting the neighbors in terms of light or privacy. The relocated right side egress doors (replacing windows in that location) will allow for access down to the patio (currently existing, but in need of improvement).  This egress area and patio is buffered by a 6 feet high fence at the property line, which provides privacy.","No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the relocated, enlarged and new windows and doors should have a limited impact on abutters. With the exception of the immediate rear abutters, there are no other inhabitants or passersby who will be able to see the altered and new windows due to their location at the rear of this relatively small home tucked back from the street with larger buildings to the rear and right side.  (See photo of the rear of the house taken from the sidewalk on Gray Street).  The residences that abut the new egress doors have few or no windows from which to see the new doors, and thus should not experience any nuisance or hazard.  The petitioners will cause all construction to comply with State Building Code and other fire code requirements applicable to openings located near a property line.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the window alterations, new windows and doors will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.",Boston,MA,05/29/2019

Compliance with the current setback requirements for the vertical expansion of the one story portion of the building would create a substantial hardship and would significantly limit the reuse of the existing building as an academic theater. In order to provide code compliant egress, MAAB required access and for programmatic reasons, the new theater structure can only fit in the existing one story building area, thus requiring variances.  The black box theater that MIT wishes to construct cannot be accommodated within the required setbacks.  Disallowing the teaching theater would hinder the core educational purposes of the university and cause a substantial hardship for MIT, nullifying its educational use.","The vertical expansion of the one story portion of the building does not change the street level condition on Vassar Street except where the entrance has been set back from the sidewalk to make it more welcoming and to allow visibility into the interior teaching space.  The parapet of the vertical expansion is 5’-0” above the neighboring building.  Mechanical rooftop screening will be provided so that equipment cannot be viewed from other parts of the neighborhood. The vertical expansion is contained within the existing building footprint and imposes no substantial detriment to the public good.  In fact, the new use enlivens this part of Vassar Street by providing active uses visible from the street.","The required setbacks in the SD-11 zoning district are designed to allow spatial and visual relief from the impact of an 85 foot high building on a relatively small site.  Since the existing site is already fully built out and a portion of the existing building is already two stories, a small addition at a similar height that  is well under the allowed building height, will not dominate or feel overly dense.    The pedestrian experience will be enhanced as the vertical addition on the Vassar Street side will be setback from the lot line and the parapet at the street wall will remain one story as it is today except at the building entrance where it is setback 3-‘0” from the front lot line.Strict compliance with the setback requirements or limits to the expansion of a lawfully non-conforming building would substantially diminish or detract from the usefulness of the building, impairing the mission of MIT without appreciably advancing the City’s legitimate concerns.","This area of the SD-11 District is almost completely built out.  This special district was created in 1992, replacing the Industry B district on this end of Vassar Street.  The prior zoning had no setback requirements and allowed for an FAR of  4.0.  This portion of SD-11 abuts the Grand Junction railroad track, MIT academic buildings, MIT Investment property and is across the street from the Hyatt Hotel. There are no residences nearby. The SD-11 zoning allows a height of 85 feet but the buildings on this side of Vassar Street are currently one to two stories.  The proposed vertical expansion of the one story portion of the building will result in a height of 35’-6”, well below the maximum height of the zoning district.","The addition of windows on facades of the building not facing Vassar Street will bring light into the building, consistent with the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance with respect to providing adequate light and conserving natural resources.","345 Vassar Street will be used for Institutional purposes and parking will be provided using MIT’s Institutional parking inventory.  MIT manages all parking spaces as one inventory.  Commuting faculty, staff, students or patrons would park on the West Lot or Westgate Lot.  In addition, MIT has a shuttle stop across the street and there is a Hubway station at Westgate.  If any performances are open to the public, they are likely to held on nights and weekends during which times faculty and staff use of such parking lots is minimized.  If special events are held, the event parking would be at established campus parking facilities.",The existing windows do not align with the new uses within the building and the design team wishes to maximize daylighting by relocating the existing openings in the rear and west walls. The relocation of these openings requires a special permit from the ZBA.  The new window openings do not affect the neighboring uses as they are similar in scale to the existing openings.The proposed use is permitted as-of-right.  Adjacent uses will not be affected by the addition of windows on facades not facing Vassar Street.,"The building was formerly used for commercial laboratory uses for a bio-tech company.  MIT is proposing to use the building to house faculty offices, studios and a large teaching space for the Theater Department.","The district is a non-residential area with a diverse set of uses including Commercial Laboratory, Industrial, Institutional and Hotel Uses.  MIT owns the adjacent properties and the property across the street is used for MIT’s Resource Development Department and Alumni Association.  The district abuts the MIT campus and is separated from Cambridgeport by the Grand Junction Rail Corridor.  The zoning for SD-11 encourages a variety of uses including Office, Manufacturing, packaging, retail and consumer services.

Harvard is requesting relief under CZO 20.54.3 to permit a women’s clothing store, Looks LLC, for retail sale of merchandise in a structure constructed after June 1, 1985.Two Arrow Street is located in an active, mixed-use neighborhood in Harvard Square contiguous to Massachusetts Avenue, with the majority of buildings having retail or consumer service uses on the ground floor. Arrow Street has a number of consumer-oriented uses fronting on the street, including food retail, dry cleaning, tailor and shoe repair, jewelry, books, acupuncture massage and frozen yogurt, as shown in the attachments.  The empty frontage at Two Arrow Street is a missing gap in an otherwise near continuous frontage of active ground floor spaces.A literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would not allow a retail use in the first floor space of the building in the Office-3 zoning district and would result in this well-designed street level space continuing to be underutilized.  A store for retail sale of merchandise is not an allowed use in the Office-3 district. Looks LLC is an independently owned women’s clothing store with four employees.  The store opened in Harvard Square in 1975 and relocated from Massachusetts Avenue to its existing 11 Holyoke Street location in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  The store will relocate as it will be displaced due to a building renovation at the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center.   To maintain its loyal customer base, it is very important that the new retail location remain in Harvard Square.  Harvard is proposing that this retail use relocate to the space at Two Arrow Street, which is well-suited for the store given the large number adjacent retail and consumer service uses and the attractive storefront windows facing the street.  The store will occupy approximately 1,100 SF in the Two Arrow location.","This project directly responds to the goals of the Harvard Square Overlay District and is compatible with existing uses.  Rather than create a detriment to the public good, the proposed project will increase activity on Arrow Street, provide services to shoppers in Harvard Square, increase pedestrian activity and assist locally owned businesses by contributing to the retail environment.  The requested variance is needed to occupy this ground floor space in Harvard Square with an active retail use, in a space that has been vacant for over a decade.  Therefore, the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public good.  On the contrary, the granting of the variance will in fact be a benefit to the public good, as the retail use of the ground floor space with large windows will activate the sidewalk and street at this location, and enhance the public’s enjoyment of this part of Harvard Square.","The requested variance will allow the retail use of a ground floor space with four large windows at Two Arrow Street in Harvard Square, which is consistent with the goals of the Harvard Square Overlay District.  Thus, granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.  The project is consistent with the goals, except for the date of construction of the building, that the building is not a National Register or contributing building or important open space, and that it is not related to a mechanism to preserve a historic building (Sections 20.54.3.a, b and c).","The existing structure was built in an Office-3 district in 2003 and was carefully designed to respond to the pedestrian and urban environment.  The building is a four story building containing Oberon, a 300-seat theater of the American Repertory Theater, and approximately 24,000 square feet of office space in an Office-3 district.  In 2003, the Planning Board granted a Special Permit to the project with conditions, and alluded to its potential future use as a more active street-level use.  As noted in the 2003 findings, the theater was built within a heterogeneous environment of buildings and uses.  Commercial, residential and cultural activities abound in a mix of buildings of different scales and materials.  The building was carefully designed to bridge those two extremes with facades that are enlivened with much detail and strategic setbacks that provide a transition to the smaller structures.    The decision noted (page 6) “Particularly on its Arrow Street side, the design introduces an engaging and accessible ground floor that has the potential to accommodate a wide range of pedestrian friendly activities in the years ahead.”    The decision also noted (page 14) that “the site is surrounded by a range of institutional, office, retail and residential uses.  Numerous retail stores, small and moderately sized restaurants, and upper story office and residential uses occur in the immediate vicinity of the site.”The hardship is owing to the physical characteristics of the first floor space.  The majority of the ground floor is used by the theater.  The space proposed for retail use has served as a meeting room for office use.  However, as the meeting room is not adjacent to the offices in the building, the space has been virtually unused for more than ten years.    The small size does not work for many types of office uses and would not allow room for business expansion.  Typically an office use on the first floor does not interact with the street outside in a visual manner, likely using window treatments on the windows. However, the space is well suited for a small retail establishment such as Looks.  The floor to ceiling windows work very well for a retail use because window displays are an essential element to successful retail stores, drawing in shoppers and increasing sales by highlighting the merchandise for sale.  A dedicated entryway already exists that could be used for the store, thus requiring no physical changes to the exterior of the building.The building is located within the Harvard Square Overlay District. This district has a set of goals that encourage active ground floor uses, a pedestrian-oriented environment, and support of a diversity of uses serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, and visitors.  As noted in CZO 20.52, it is the purpose of the overlay district to augment existing zoning regulations to respond to unique problems and pressures for change particular to the Harvard Square area, including enhancing the unique functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square.  The additional flexibility in the zoning is intended to facilitate the protection and character of Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. The regulations of the Harvard Square Overlay District offer flexibility for retail uses in districts where retail uses are not permitted. CZO 20.54.3 allows by Special Permit the retail use of a structure in the Harvard Square Overlay District if certain conditions are met. While Two Arrow Street meets the majority of these criteria, it does not conform to several of the conditions that relate to the age and historic designation of the building, and therefore is not eligible to seek a special permit.  Harvard is seeking to allow retail use through a variance granted for CZO 20.54.3, with the criteria enumerated below as well as how the proposal meets those criteria.a.	Criterion:  The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met. Evaluation:  Yes, this proposal for a new retail use meets the goals of the Harvard Square Overlay District to preserve and enhance the unique functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square. b.	Criterion: The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985 and will not involve significant new construction.Evaluation: No, the building was not in existence in 1985. The proposal does not call for new construction.c.	Criterion: The addition of such use(s) will assist in preservation, rehabilitation and/or restoration of a National Register or contributing building or important open space by increasing the economic feasibility of maintaining such features. Evaluation: No, the proposed use does not impact any historic buildings or open spaces.d.	Criterion: The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in criterion c. above is assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the special permit is in force and effect.Evaluation: No, the proposed use does not involve the preservation of a building or an open space.e.	Criterion: The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate, or restore the outward appearance of the structure.Evaluation: Yes, the proposed use will preserve the exterior of the building.f.	Criterion: In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different from the uses permitted in the base district. Evaluation: Yes, the retail use will have a similar impact to other permitted uses in Office-3 district.g.	Criterion:  The use is completely contained within the structure.Evaluation:  Yes, the use will be fully contained with the Two Arrow building.h.	Criterion:  The use will be substantially patronized by pedestrians, and will, if required by the Planning Board, function adequately without additional off street parking or loading facilities and will in any case not generate vehicular traffic in quantity and type substantially from that generated by permitted uses.Evaluation:  Yes, the current business patrons of the existing Harvard Square Looks location are predominantly pedestrian, and the change in location across four city blocks is not anticipated to change the transportation patterns of the store customers.i.	Criterion:  The applicant can demonstrate a need for the use(s) as a service to adjacent residential communities or to the academic community and can demonstrate that for economic or other reasons the use cannot easily be located in existing business or office districts where the use is permitted. In addition the applicant must demonstrate that either the use has been displaced as a result of redevelopment elsewhere in the Harvard Square Overlay District, or that the use is important in its contribution to the variety, continuity, or uniqueness of the Harvard Square Overlay District.Evaluation: Yes, the proposed women’s clothing store, Looks, is a very useful service to the adjacent residential and academic community. As a locally-owned retailer with unique clothing, it is a treasured resource with a loyal Harvard Square customer base. Looks is currently located at 11 Holyoke Street in the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center, also in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  As this building will undergo a significant renovation as a campus center beginning in spring 2016, Looks must relocate to another location.j.	Criterion:  The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.Evaluation:  Yes, the current use is an underutilized office meeting room and is not a residential or dormitory use.k.	Criterion:  The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however specifically prohibited.Evaluation:  Yes, the proposed retail use is not among the list of prohibited uses.l.	Criterion:  The proposed use is not located in a base Residence C-2B or Office 2 District.Evaluation:  Yes, the proposed use is located in an Office 3 District.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,02/18/2016

(CZO 8.22.3, not otherwise permitted by CZO 8.22.1 and 8.22.2)•	To permit the alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure not otherwise permitted by issuance of a building permit or special permit. PROJECT DESCRIPTION40 Concord Avenue is one of four buildings that comprise what is referred to as the “Bunting Quadrangle.” The building was originally constructed as a residence in 1877, and has been in institutional use since 1911. The current Radcliffe use of the building is allowed by a special permit granted by the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal (BZA) in 1985. The special permit allows the use of the Bunting Quadrangle property for administrative, faculty and staff offices and studios, teaching and research facilities, library space and related service facilities. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study is proposing to renovate 40 Concord Avenue for continued institutional use. The renovated building will house library support space for the Institute’s Schlesinger Library and offices for other Radcliffe departments.  The project includes upgrading of building systems and infrastructure and the reorganization and renovation of interior spaces. The proposed scope of work triggers certain compliance requirements with the Massachusetts State Building Code and the regulations of the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board.  These requirements include the creation of an independent second means of egress and modifications to make the building accessible to persons with disabilities (at present the building is not accessible). The project proposes a small addition, (1,377 GSF) at the south side of the building to facilitate the required improvements. The addition will contain the required second means of egress, a new accessible entrance, accessible toilet rooms, and a lobby area at each floor of the building. A new elevator, serving all floors of the building will be installed within the existing building volume.     SUPPORTING STATEMENTThe proposed addition will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (CZO) with the exception of the areas of requested zoning relief. The buildings that comprise the Bunting Quadrangle were all built prior to the adoption of the CZO and its provisions which govern the maximum allowable floor area permitted on a lot. The lot containing 40 Concord Avenue is split between two zoning districts: Residence B and Residence A-2.  The existing gross floor area within both portions of the lot exceeds that allowed by the maximum floor area ratio for each zoning district, and is therefore considered non-conforming. 40 Concord Avenue is also non-conforming for height, exceeding the maximum 35’ building height in the Residence B zone by approximately 6’.  The proposed addition on the south side of the building will add 1,377 square feet of space that is attributable to gross floor area.  This addition will increase the nonconformity of the maximum gross floor area on the lot, and the corresponding FAR. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require that the required code compliance and accessibility modifications be accommodated within the building’s existing floor area and volume. Fully meeting the specific dimensional and spatial requirements associated with the required modifications within the building would result in the loss of approximately 800 square feet, or about 24 % of the building’s assignable floor area and have significant structural impacts. This alternative would also not enable an accessible entrance in close proximity to the site’s accessible parking, making it far less desirable for persons with disabilities. These impacts would present a substantial hardship for the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study as it would significantly limit the Institute’s ability to address its programmatic space needs within its existing buildings, and to meet its accessibility obligations. The proposed addition has a building wall containing a first floor window that is within 10 feet of the existing on grade parking area.  These windows, which provide light into the addition’s new egress stairway, will be non-operable.  A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require either the removal of the window, eliminating natural daylight at this level of the stairway; or the relocation of the parking spaces nearest the addition which provides one of the building’s two new accessible entrances. This would create a hardship for the Institute by making the location of parking less convenient to the new accessible entry. The requested zoning relief will allow Radcliffe to make required accessibility and life safety improvements to 40 Concord Avenue without losing a substantial amount of programmatic space within the building. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would necessitate a more limited renovation scope, precluding full building accessibility and needed life safety improvements, and therefore place limitations on the building’s continued institutional use.","The proposed addition has been located unobtrusively at the rear of the building, to minimize its visibility to the public, and designed in a manner that is sensitive to the existing historic building and the surrounding neighborhood. The proposed renovation will result in significant improvements in life safety for building occupants and accessibility for persons with disabilities. The requested relief allows the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study to undertake a more comprehensive renovation of the building, furthering the long-term preservation of this historic resource. The proposed project is also consistent with the City’s institutional growth policies which encourage the increased utilization of existing institutional facilities and sites.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place and to be altered and expanded. The proposed addition can be readily accommodated on the site in a manner that respects the historic character of the building, and does not impact the overall physical character of the Bunting Quadrangle or the surrounding neighborhood. The nominal amount of new gross floor area being added will not intensify the existing institutional use, but will allow Radcliffe to make more effective use of an existing facility. Therefore, the requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance. Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will further the preservation of a non-conforming historic structure while significantly improving its efficiency and functionality.","40 Concord Avenue was originally constructed in 1877 as a single-family residence. Although the building has been in institutional use since 1911, it has seen limited physical modification from its original residential use.  As a building in institutional use it must comply with many building and code requirements (including those related to life safety and accessibility) that would not normally affect structures in private residential use. The layout, configuration and structural characteristics of what was originally a residential building create limitations on accommodating the upgrades and other modifications required for contemporary institutional uses. The combination of the building’s physical characteristics and its continued utilization for permitted institutional uses are a condition that does not generally affect properties located in the Residence B zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,05/13/2016

The structure is a wood framed Single-family with multi-level split floors connected by open stairs built in 1975.  Currently there are two (2) bedrooms and three (3) bathrooms.  One of the baths is located in the basement area relatively remote from the main living areas.  The basemnt area has a door that exits directly outside and is not desirable as an additional bedroom.  The site of the addition is above a single story garage with a roof deck built in 1988.  The roof deck is a half level up and accessed from a bay off the kitchen area.  With the requested relief granted Petitioners would be able to create a separate bedroom for each child that is in reasonably close proximity to the parents bedroom while staying with allowed FAR.,"Desirable relief may be granted without detriment to the public good because the addition is within the existing foot print of the building and will not detrimentally impact the abutters.

This property is in the C-1 zone, and thus allows a maximum of 3 units (1,500 SF lot/D.U.).  The Owner currently has two building permits for the redevelopment of the lot: one for the modification of the existing two family structure on the front of the lot, and one for the construction of a new single family structure at the rear of the lot.  After considerable interaction and discussion with the abutters, it has become clear that the neighborhood would prefer not to have a separate structure on the rear of the property.  The Owner and his Architect designed another option, which includes the elimination of the back structure with the 3rd unit, and an enlargement of the existing, non-conforming two family structure.  This is the proposal before you now, which would require zoning relief.  Knowing that neighborhood support would be needed for a variance, the Owner approached the abutters with the current proposal.  After considerable email communication, and a neighborhood meeting at the home of an abutter, an agreement was reached that was satisfactory to both the abutters and the Owner, which is attached.Zoning relief requested:1.	Move existing structure 1.3’ (one foot and four inches) to the west (right).  This will have the following effect.a.	Left side setback: according to the certified plot plan by Ron Carter Associates, the existing house is located OVER the property line by 0.3’, protruding into the 9’ Passageway between 2-4 and 6-8 Emmons Place.  Moving the building 1.3’ will correct this protrusion over the property line, will create a conforming driveway dimension (10’) between the two structures, and will considerably ease the parking access into the rear of the lots for both 6-8 as well as 2-4 Emmons Place.b.	Front setback: moving the house 1.3’ to the west will not increase the non-conformity, as the existing front setback will be maintained.c.	Right side setback: moving the house 1.3’ to the west will increase the existing non-conformity from 4.8’ to 3.5 feet. This nearest property line backs onto parking of the abutting property, so the impact is minimal.2.	Create an addition at the rear of the existing structure.  The proposed size of the addition is generated by the reasonable size of habitable rooms on the first and 2nd floors, and to allow for egress windows to be created for the basement bedrooms.  This proposed addition has the following zoning consequences:a.	Left side setback: the left side setback of the new addition and decks will be non-conforming, and will require a variance from the ordinance. b.	Rear setback: is conformingc.	Right side setback: the right side setback of the new addition and decks will be non-conforming, and will require a variance from the ordinance.3.	G.F.A.  Article 8 states that for any non-conforming structure, an addition of greater than 25% requires a variance.  The Proposed addition and renovation of the existing structure creates GFA which does not exceed the allowable for the site.  The allowable GFA for this lot is 3,711SF.  The proposed GFA for this project is 3,669 SF.  4.	Reconstruction of the existing structure.  Due to the poor condition of the existing foundation and roof structure, and due to the reframing requirements of the floor systems, we are requesting the ability to rebuild the entire structure in its existing envelope.A literal enforcement of the ordinance would not allow for either the moving of the structure to the west, or the proposed addition to this structure.  Article 8 requires that an addition of greater than 25% to a non-conforming structure obtain a variance.  However the moving of the structure by 1.3’ to the west, while decreasing a non-conformity on one side, and increasing it on the other, provides a benefit to correct a property line issue, and improves the vehicular access to the rear of the lot for 5 homes (3 in 2-4 Emmons Place, and 2 in 6-8 Emmons Place).  The addition to this structure is, by what appears to be a unanimous voice in the neighborhood, a far superior solution than the creation of a separate stand-alone unit in the rear of the lot, which is currently permitted.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  To the contrary, allowing the moving of the structure will improve vehicular access for 5 homes.  Reconstruction of the structure and allowing the proposed addition at the rear of the structure will retain the fabric of the four similar houses at the end of Emmons Place, and will better match the historical pattern of growth for this neighborhood.  In further support of the public good, this proposal reduces the unit count for this lot from 3 to 2, thus alleviating density in the area.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its mission, among many things, to “…to lessen congestion in the streets;… to secure safety from fire,… to provide adequate light and air; to prevent overcrowding of land …”.  The granting of relief for this proposal achieves all of these goals.","The hardship is owing to the configuration of the narrow and long lot, which creates non-conformities with respect to both left and right side setbacks on the existing structure.  There is also the highly unusual condition that this property, as well as 2-4 Emmons Place, abut a “9’ Passageway”, which is neither owned by either property, nor claimed by the City.  This is evidently due to the pattern of land division going back to the early 1800’s, and visible on the maps at the Cambridge Historical Commission.","The Appellant and Owner of 6-8 Emmons Place wishes to obtain a Special Permit in this application, as follows:1. To use an existing driveway for access to the rear of the lot for parking.  The Owner is proposing to demolish the existing structue and rebuild it 16"" to the West, and to build an addition at the rear of this new structure. Moving the structure will creat a conforming 10' driveway, which will serve the rear parking for this 2 family structure, as well as the 3 units at 2-4 Emmons Place. The Zoning Ordinance would normally required a 5' buffer between a driveway and the property line.  The proposed design will require relief of the 5' buffer requirements. The new structure proposed at 6-8 Emmons Place would normally required a conforming driveway, with a 5' buffer setback from the property line.  The house is currently over the property line by 0.3"", according to the survey.  The Owner proposes to rebuild the structure in a position that creates a conforming 10 driveway between structures.  Therefore, the proposed building will be 1' from the property line.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would not allow the building to be in this position.The Board can consider that this lot is narrow for the C-1 Zone, which poses challenges to this modification. The relief sought for this would recognize the challenges of the lot.","This proposed position of the new structure improves the access and egress from the parking areas for each of the abutting structures., and the work will not affect patterns access or egress or cause any additional congestion.",The proposed modifications do not affect the use or future development of any adjacent uses.,There will be no creation of any nuisance or hazard.,"The proposed modifications will not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district, or derogate from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.",Cambridge,MA,03/28/2016

The added floor space of the proposed addition, which triggers the variance is needed to add a second bathroom to this floor. Having only the single bathroom on this floor is a hardship, as the family prepares for work and school at the same time every morning, and the lack of privacy between the adults and soon to be teenage daughters. The first floor has no coat closet at either front or rear entry, and only one half bath, which was installed (by the previous owner) in the dining room. The proposed rear addition, located on the footprint of the existing covered screen porch, would provide space for a rear entry, coat closets, and the re-location of the half bath to that area. The lack of closet space at the front and rear entries, makes everyday living difficult, and having the only first floor toilet room opening directly into the dining room is neither compatible nor healthy.","The proposed two story addition will only add approximately 165 sq.ft. to the habitable area of the existing house, since the addition is to be located on the footprint of the one story existing covered screen porch. The height, size, and minimal presence of the proposed addition at the rear of the existing house will present negligible change to the house, site and neighborhood.","The proposed modest addition and deck will not nullify or substantially derogate the intent of the ordinance, since it will minimally increase the footprint of th existing house. This increase (the size of the proposed deck) will still adhere to ordinance setback requirements. The modest increased floor area and volume of the addition will have negligible impact on the house, site, and neighborhood.","Because of the layout of the stairs, hallway, and bedrooms on the second floor, and the house's existing plumbing system, it is very difficult to accommodate a second bathroom within the existing second floor footprint. On the first floor the layout of the stairs, rooms, doors, and hallways, prevents entry area closet space and a half bath from being satisfactorily accommodated within the main part of the first floor.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,04/27/2016

During the winters the roof has almost collapsed from weight of snow. The customer had to go out and shovel it off (with no railings). they have investigated many options to remedy the situation and have decided the most attractive idea would be to install one of our sunrooms in that area. It would be slightly smaller than the existing roof but gabled to elevate most of the snow. a 4.3 x 18.1 deck along the side of the room would allow for a safe structure with railings to safely remove snow. the remaining roof is new rubber and had a large A/C for house. they would like to avoid disturbing that area if possible.,Variance:  Addition of sunroom on a flat roof.,3334,3538,2948,2948,2948,2948,1.13,1.24,.75,2948,2948,1500,41.02,41.02,41.02,88.8,88.8,88.8,44.87,44.87,10,13.1,13.1,20,1.8,1.8,7.5,13.4,13.4,7.5,35,35,35,18.1,18.1,18.1,11.8,11.8,11.8,50.9,50.9,50,2,2,2,4,4,4,0,0,0,2.5,2.5,2.5,"We propose to add a gabled prefabricated sunroom made of southern yellow pine beams, aluminum extrusion (exterior) and tinted, insulated glass to replace a flat roof which causes snow issues. We propose a deck be added with railings so the snow can be safely removed.","To remedy this dangerous situation would requie the homeowner to reaise the center section of existing roof by more than 7'. Anything,including attic space, with a ceiling higher than 7' will add to the FAR. The existing FAR already exceeds what is allowed on the lot. No matter what they do it would require a variance and be costly. To go through all the work and expense necessary to remedy the situation and not get at least some addtional use or value out of the area, in our opinion, is the very definition of a hardship.","granting this variance would have no negative effect to the public good. the room does not affect the neighbors in any way or anyone's use of their property. It does not expand the footprint of the house or go above the level of the existing roof. In fact, it will not be visable from the street.","We feel granting the variance would not substantially derogate from the intent of the ordinance. the ordinance is to prevent people from putting too large of a house on a lot in this area. This sunroom addition is on the third floor and would be located on a roof that already exists. it is not making the house taller, wider or longer than it already is. We feel granting a variance would keep within the spirit and intent of the ordinance.","The property has 2 hardships. The first is the structure of the house. There are some houses in the area with small sections of flat roof, but none that come close to the size of this flat roof area. They did not create this condition, but inherited this problem when they bought the house. At the time they had no idea of how big a problem it would be. The second hardship is the shape of the lot and the location of the house on it. Because the lot is long and skinny and th ehouse is situated so far over to the left. It is impossible to push the snow off the left side of the flat roof without it landing on the neighbors yard. if you push the snow off to teh right it blocks the driveway. This leaves only the back yard to pile it up, which is part of the plan.",,,,,,Auburn,MA,08/04/2016

Proposed reconstruction of the deck and new mud room will be wood frame construction with painted wood shingle siding and asphalt shingle roof.,"There is no other viable building entry that could accommodate a mud room addition. To create an alternative entry area with mud room will create significant financial hardship to the owners to remodel the interior of the home as well as the mud room addition. The building in its existing condition is inadequate for reasonable uses such that the failure to grant an exception could be considered unreasonable. The hardship is the current zoning and existing footprint does not allow for adding a mud room without violating the side yard setback, and the cost to do a mud room elsewhere is financially unfeasible.","The existing, non-conforming porch is proposed to be re-built to include a mudroom addition that is not substantially more detrimental than the existing structure to the neighborhood. There is no new impact on the side yard setback because the existing nonconforming porch is already within the setback area. The footprint of the new mud room is the exact same width, and a lesser depth, as the existing nonconforming deck. There is no new impact on rainwater runoff because the impervious surface of the existing porch already drains the area. There is no alteration to the character of the neighborhood, which consists of similarly sized homes, ages and nonconforming to modern setbacks. Therefore, granting a variance will not reduce the values of the surrounding properties.","The existing porch is nonconforming, located within the side yard setback and therefore the mud room addition would simply be an enclosed structure within an already nonconforming preexisting condition. The mud room does not change the nonconforming footprint of the existing deck, it simply encloses a portion.",The existing building footprint and lot size are nonconforming due to the age of the building and changes in zoning requirements post-construction.

We are asking for permission to build home using wood frame construction and spray foam insulation.  The foundation will be made from 5,000 PSI concrete with steel reinforcement.  There will be a highly insulated metal roof with solar panels on top for efficiency, longevity, and ease of maintenance.","If the provisions of the Ordinance are literally enforced, we will not be able to move into a home and neighborhood where we want to raise a family.  We purchased our home with the intention of renovating the interior prior to moving in.  Following a permitted interior demolition, we discovered that structural joists providing lateral support as well as four of the five roof joists were cut as part of an illegal construction project.  There was poorly repaired fire damage to the frame of the house.  Due to these deficiencies and damages in the brick and mortar foundation, the house was deemed structurally unsound and uninhabitable by a certified structural engineer.  As a result, we need to demolish the existing nonconforming structure and build a new home.  However, if the Ordinances are literally enforced, there is no way to build a conforming structure on the property.  Granting permission for this variance will enable a new family to join the Cambridge community in a safe home of adequate size for parents with one child and space for grandparents to stay when providing childcare support.","The requested project will not be detrimental to the public.  The planned residence is in line with the size and character of surrounding homes.  The plans also incorporate several environmentally friendly elements to including a roof optimized for most efficient capture of solar energy and two 240 volt outlets in the carport in anticipation of putting in a fast charger for electric vehicles in the future.  There will be no negative impact on the neighborhood and, if permission is granted, it will enable a new family to become part of an active part of a vibrant and diverse community.","The requested project will not substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance.  We want to rebuild a single-family house with the same footprint as the current non-conforming structure.  The increase in FAR is largely due to the fact that we are planning on finishing the basement in order to increase livable space without increasing the footprint above ground.  We are removing the brick and mortar foundation that is collapsing inward and has already bowed in over 5+ inches on the west side and replacing it with a modern reinforced concrete foundation for increased structural support and stability.  The current basement does not count in the FAR as it the ceiling height is only 6'.  The GIS data reports the current house to be 1058 square feet.  However, that does not include the existing finished attic space.  If that space is included, the total square footage is approximately 1,200 square feet.  In the house we are proposing to build, the livable space above the basement will be about 1,300 square feet.  This modest increase is due to changing current roof line to be a south facing single slant roof in order to accommodate solar panels.  The height of the proposed building will not exceed the maximum height requirements for zone C-1 and will be less than existing structures on adjacent blocks.  There will be no increase in the number of residents relative to its previous occupancy and no significant impact on road traffic and street parking.","The hardship is due to the size and shape of the land.  In C-1, the minimum setbacks surrounding a dwelling are 10' in the front and 20' at the back.  As the entire length of the lot in question is only 30', if the provisions of the Ordinance were literally enforced, it would be impossible to build a dwelling on the property.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,11/22/2016

The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Retail Use (CZO 4.35.a, 4.35.e, 4.35.f.1, Retail Business and Consumer Service Establishments)•	To allow the establishment of a retail / restaurant useVariance 2: Front yard setback to Everett Street(CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum front yard)•	Everett Street:  To permit the building to be built to the street line of Everett Street, less than the 5’ minimum, while conforming to the formula requirement to the centerline of the street.Variance 3: Side yard setbacks to north and east(CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum side yard)•	North: To permit the setback of the upper floors and a portion of the ground floor which exceeds the height of the one-story abutting building, with a partially compliant ground floor that meets the adjacent property that has an existing non-conforming setback. •	East:  To permit the setback of 20’-4”, less than the required 24’ setback.Special Permit: Required Parking for Retail Business and Consumer Service Establishments(CZO 6.35, Relief from Parking Requirements for Retail Use)•	To waive the required parking for retail or restaurant use while meeting the parking requirements for the institutional educational useHarvard has held an open house for the community and met multiple times with abutters and the neighborhood. Input from the community has resulted in changes to the project reflected in this application.Project DescriptionHarvard Law School is proposing a new four-story building (20,925 SF) on the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Everett Street.  The mixed use building will combine retail or restaurant use on the ground floor, as requested by the community, with HLS public service law clinic programs on the upper floors.  The proposed mixed use building is well suited to this site located at the transition between the scale and use of the academic campus and the Massachusetts Avenue mixed use corridor. Approval of the requested variances will allow HLS to achieve its programmatic goals within the site’s allowable FAR and height, optimizing the ground floor space for retail or restaurant use and appropriately engaging with the surrounding streetscapes. The proposed building will meet all of the provisions of the CZO with the exception of the areas of requested zoning relief.  Retail useMassachusetts Avenue between Harvard Law School and Porter Square presents a consistent corridor of ground floor retail uses that contribute to a dynamic urban environment.  In order to foster an active streetscape along Massachusetts Avenue at the proposed project site, the community has requested that any new development on this site include ground floor retail space. This commitment to maintain the neighborhood vitality through ground floor retail use at this site was codified in 2007 in an Implementation Agreement between Harvard and the Agassiz and Neighborhood Nine communities. In response to the community’s desires and this commitment, the project proposes to include approximately 1,875 square feet of ground floor space dedicated to a retail or restaurant use. The proposed retail use represents a continuation of a long-established commercial presence at this site.  As early as the 1920’s, the site has accommodated retail uses, most notably Bence’s Pharmacy.   In more recent years, the site has housed a food establishment (Three Aces Pizza), a dry cleaner (Crimson Cleaners), an apparel store (Looks), and a barbershop (Central Barbershop).  Since 2008, the existing building has been vacant to facilitate an extensive environmental remediation effort.  The Residence C-2A zoning district does not permit retail uses, and the pre-existing nonconforming retail uses have been abandoned for more than two years.  Therefore, the re-establishment of retail use on the site is not permitted as-of-right. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would disallow retail use on the ground floor, and would result in the ground floor being used for another use, likely additional institutional educational use, which may not provide the type and level of street activity that is desired by the community.Front Yard Setback on Everett StreetThe design intent of the project is to create a building that appropriately transitions between the scale and character of the institutional academic buildings and the mixed use commercial corridor to the north on Massachusetts Avenue.   The project site abuts a one-story commercial building with a barbershop to the north, residential condominium buildings to the north and east, and HLS’s Wasserstein Hall to the south across Everett Street. The existing building on the site, a one-story retail structure, has existed at the corner of Everett Street since its construction in 1913. As with the vast majority of retail space along this section of Massachusetts Avenue, the building is built to the property line. This development pattern allowed the building to maximize the retail square footage on this small site while creating a service driveway to the rear.While originally the project studied maintaining the building line along Massachusetts Avenue, the design has been adjusted to meet the 5’ setback from the property line in consideration of the recent rezoning of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District that seeks to increase sidewalk widths along Mass. Ave.  The project proposes to maintain the current building line along Everett Street to permit the creation of a viable retail space and a well-marked building entrance for the upper floors facing Mass. Ave. Given the constraints of the small site and the need to create a workable floor plate, the proposed footprint also allows the rear of the property to have a service driveway. While this siting will meet the CZO formula front yard setback requirements as measured to the centerline, it will require a variance from the required minimum 5’ front yard setback to the property line.  A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require that the building be set back 5’ from the property line at Everett Street, diminishing the viability and efficiency of the proposed retail space and impacting building circulation.Side Yard Setback - NorthOn the north side of the lot, the side yard directly abuts the one-story commercial building at 1619 Massachusetts Avenue.  The CZO (CZO 5.31.3.c) allows the new building to be constructed flush with the length and height of abutting buildings built to the property line. A variance is requested for the side yard setback for the height of floors 2-4 that will exceed the 11’ height of the abutting building, which is an existing non-conforming condition.The proposed building has been designed to bridge the scale between the academic institutional buildings to the south, including the 75’ Wasserstein Hall directly to the south, the neighboring three- and four-story residential buildings, and the abutting one-story commercial building. To do this, the proposed building has been designed to align with the fourth floor of Wasserstein Hall, which is 51’ in height. The abutting one-story commercial building is an atypical building in this area with its very small footprint and 11’ height, built to the side property line. The proposed project seeks to connect to this party wall, as allowed under the zoning code, and the proposal to extend the building height in this location is intended to provide a more appropriate urban design character. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require a one story wing at this part of the site, resulting in a very awkward and out-of-scale appearance, and would not be read as a single volume at odds with the character of the streetscape. Furthermore, the proposed building’s first floor would need to step down from a 15’ ceiling height to 11’, resulting in a non-consistent retail space.  The requested variance will allow the northern wing of the building to achieve four floors, creating a stronger street wall and providing much needed space for the law clinic programs. Shadow studies show a minimal impact on the abutters for the majority of the year, and the open space will be landscaped in coordination with the abutters.Side Yard Setback - EastThe abutting property to the east is a three-story residential condominium building built to the property line with a blank wall in one section. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would allow Harvard to build flush with this wall, creating an irregularly shaped building footprint not suitable for a retail use, and creating a discontinuous rear yard with landlocked open space. The proposed building will encroach 3½ feet into the setback to allow a better landscape layout, an efficient retail floor plate, and provide a partially landscaped buffer to the abutting property.","This project directly responds to the goals of the community and is compatible with existing uses and neighborhood context.  Rather than create a detriment to the public good, the proposed project will increase retail activity on Massachusetts Avenue, increase pedestrian activity, contribute to the retail environment, and replace a vacant building with a re-activated and attractive new building. The project is responding to a community desire for ground floor retail space.  The upper floors will provide space for Harvard Law School public service law clinic programs. Therefore, the granting of the variances will facilitate this activation and improvement to the neighborhood and therefore will not be detrimental to the public good.  On the contrary, the granting of the variance provide public benefit as the retail use of the ground floor space will activate the sidewalk and street at this location, and enhance the public’s enjoyment of this part of Massachusetts Avenue.","The project will allow the redevelopment of an important site along Massachusetts Avenue, the City’s most major commercial thoroughfare, and will maintain the longstanding retail use of this site. The project is consistent with the stated purpose of the CZO, namely “the encouragement of economic development” and “to preserve and increase the amenities of the City”.  Thus, granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.","Retail useThe location of the proposed retail use, on Massachusetts Avenue between Harvard Square and Porter Square is characterized by a mix of uses.  This portion of Massachusetts Avenue is a major commercial and transportation corridor that has long accommodated a variety of uses, including retail, commercial, institutional, and residential. The project site directly abuts an existing retail use.  Prior existing retail uses were abandoned in order to undertake environmental remediation of the site.  Due to the length of time required to adequately clean up the site, the building has not been used for a period of more than two years, and therefore the retail uses cannot be re-established.  These factors specifically relate to soil conditions on the site, affect the project development site specifically, and do not generally affect other property in the zoning district. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would involve a substantial hardship, by not permitting the re-establishment of retail uses on the site that are desired by both Harvard and the community. SetbacksThe development lot is located at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Everett Street and for zoning purposes is considered to have two front yards.  On its north and east borders, the site has abutters built to the property line creating unique setback requirements. Due to the location and small size of the lot and the location of the abutting structures, the provision of the required two front yard setbacks has a significant impact on the ability to provide for new retail use at the ground floor while also providing for HLS programmatic needs.","The project requests a waiver from the required number on parking spaces for the retail or restaurant use.  The incorporation of retail at this location is an important feature for the community.  At this time, the building does not have a specific retail tenant identified, and Harvard is making assumptions on the type of retail (retail store or restaurant) and its capacity (1,875 sq. ft with up to 74 seats). The building will be located in a dense, urban environment where most trips are expected to be walking, biking and transit. The project will include new bike parking facilities and is located within 600 feet from MBTA bus stops, 450 feet from the Harvard shuttle stop, 2,500 feet from the Harvard MBTA subway stop, and along a pedestrian friendly retail corridor.  Like many small lots in Cambridge, this lot does not have sufficient space for a building and on-site parking.The project seeks relief for 3 - 7 parking spaces required for the following retail / restaurant uses according to the CZO formula.-	Retail (other retail establishments) with 1,875 sq. ft.  1 space for 700 sq. ft. = 3 spaces. (per CZO 6.36.5.a.2)-	Restaurant with 74 seats.  1 space for each 15 seats = 5 parking spaces (per CZO 6.36.5.e)-	Restaurant (serving alcohol) with 74 seats.   1 space for each 10 seats = 7 parking spaces (per CZO 6.36.5.f.1)It is expected that the retail use will be frequented primarily by people walking, biking, and taking the bus to the site.  The project will include 10 short-term bike spaces and 3 long-term bike spaces. In addition there are metered parking spaces in front of the building and all along on Massachusetts Avenue, which have capacity at most times.  The site has high volumes of pedestrian traffic with people traveling to and from uses in Porter Square, Harvard Square, on the Harvard University campus and other uses on Massachusetts Avenue.  The site is located at a signalized intersection with crosswalks.The size of the lot is a limiting factor in the addition of parking for retail uses.  The project includes a modification to the existing curb cut to allow short-term loading for the retail use at the back of the building.  The provision of bicycle parking will be accommodated in this area.  This area of the site will be landscaped.","Transportation consultants, VHB, have assessed the proposed mixed use development and determined that the project is not expected to result in a significant number of new destination trips to the area. The office component will be occupied largely by faculty, staff, students and visitors who currently arrive and depart Wasserstein Hall. It is expected that the street-level use will not be destination retail/restaurant in nature, but rather will attract most of its trips from existing users in the area or pass-by trips. It is expected, however, that the project will result in an increase in pedestrian activity in the vicinity of the site, as a result of both the revival of street level retail and the HLS public service programs on the upper office floors.As a result, no new off-street parking is proposed for the project, and a special permit is requested for the waiver of parking requirements for the retail use. HLS related vehicle trips will continue to be accommodated in the existing Wasserstein Hall below-grade parking garage and will be allocated for the purposes of zoning in the University’s pool. For the retail/restaurant use, any customer parking demand is expected to be satisfied by the existing large number of on-street metered parking spaces. There are approximately 153 on-street parking meter spaces within a 5-minute walk of the site.  No parking is proposed for the retail employees in order to encourage commuting by alternative modes of transportation, particularly in light of the proximity of MBTA Red Line service and bus services along Massachusetts Avenue. Wasserstein Hall is also well served by Harvard University shuttle bus service, with a shuttle stop located on its Massachusetts Avenue frontage.","The project will not adversely affect the surrounding retail, residential and institutional uses. The retail component of the project will be very similar to how the site has been used in past decades, with most customers arriving via walking, biking, or transit.","The project will not create any nuisances or hazards to the detriment of the health, safety or welfare of the abutters or the community. It will not cause excessive congestion as the vehicle trip generation is expected to be very low. It will not endanger public safety in any way. It will not substantially reduce parking availability for other uses as most retail customers will arrive via walking, biking, or transit.","The proposed waiver of retail parking is consistent with the stated purpose of the CZO Article 6.000, namely “to meet the reasonable needs of all building and land users without establishing regulations which unnecessarily encourage automobile usage.” Waiving the retail parking will meet the reasonable needs of this building and its users given the many non-auto transportation options available to this site (walking, biking, transit, shuttle), and the many on-street metered parking spaces available in the close proximity. Thus, granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested special permit will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.",Cambridge,MA,01/11/2017

The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) (CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Maximum ratio of floor area to lot area)•	To exceed the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) permitted on the lot; Variance 2: Alteration or Enlargement of a Nonconforming Structure and Use (CZO 8.22.3, not otherwise permitted by CZO 8.22.1 and 8.22.2)•	To permit the alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure not otherwise permitted by issuance of a building permit or special permit. Project Description20 Sumner Road (1923) is a 4,600 square foot wood frame building, home to the Harvard Center for Green Buildings and Cities (CGBC), a program affiliated with the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD). The building has been in institutional use since the early 1970s and owned by Harvard since 2010.  This building shares a lot with three (3) other buildings: to the north, two (2) Harvard GSD buildings; to the south, a University parking lot and a privately-owned residential condominium on a ground lease. The CGBC is a research center focused on creating and improving sustainable, high performance buildings and cities. The proposed project at 20 Sumner Road offers a unique opportunity to study and pilot innovative ideas for retrofitting a residential wood-frame structure, a predominant building form in the U.S., in an environmentally sustainable manner while supporting the research team driving this innovation. The project calls for innovative sustainability approaches including geothermal heating, 100% natural ventilation, 100% daylight autonomy. The building will feature an improved envelope, a solar chimney for ventilation, a green roof, the transformation of an existing surface parking lot to greenspace with a rain garden. The proposed scope of work triggers the regulations of the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board including the installation of new accessible entrance, accessible toilet rooms, a new elevator lift and lobbies, and other modifications. (At present the building is not accessible.)In addition to the comprehensive renovation, the project includes a small rear addition (1,468 sf) to support the CGBC research. The rear addition will be built partially below grade and equipped with a green roof to integrate visually with the surrounding landscape. The addition will contain office space for the researchers, in part to replace the work space lost from the incorporation of accessibility features into the building, as well as to study the sustainability strategies on new construction as well as existing buildings. This is of critical importance to the CGBC’s mission, which studies the effects of both new and existing construction globally.  The house renovation, along with a basement addition, would allow the house to perform as a laboratory for both construction types for researchers at the CGBC, while significantly minimizing the addition’s impact as seen from the exterior.A)	A literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant for the following reasons:The proposed addition will meet all of the provisions of the CZO with the exception of the areas of requested zoning relief.  The 20 Sumner Road structure was built in 1923 prior to the 1924 adoption of the CZO and its provisions which govern the maximum allowable floor area permitted on a lot. The structure is also considered legally nonconforming for use, setback, parking, and loading.The proposed addition on the east side of the building will add 1,468 square feet of space that is attributable to gross floor area. This addition will increase the nonconformity of the maximum gross floor area on the lot, and the corresponding FAR.  A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require that the building size remain unchanged and usable program space be reduced in order to incorporate the required code compliance and accessibility modifications.  Fully meeting the specific dimensional and spatial requirements associated with the required modifications within the building would result in the loss of approximately 300 square feet, or about 7% of the building’s floor area, which is already significantly constrained. Given the global importance of addressing sustainability challenges, the CGBC is in need of additional space to house researchers. Maintaining the structure in its current size would present a substantial hardship to the Harvard Graduate School of Design as it would significantly limit the Center for Green Buildings and Cities’ ability to address its programmatic space needs within its existing buildings and to meet its accessibility obligations.  Moreover, meeting those space needs in another location would substantially and adversely affect the academic goal of this project, which is to serve as a pilot project for sustainable renovations of residential wood-frame buildings, as well as to test out sustainable approaches for new construction, in order to support the CGBC’s overall mission.The requested zoning relief will allow the CGBC to make required accessibility improvements to 20 Sumner Road while meeting the programmatic requirement. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would necessitate a more limited renovation scope, precluding full building accessibility, needed building code improvements, and transformative sustainability improvements to the building and site. It would therefore place limitations on the building’s continued institutional use and its ability to serve as a pilot project for advancing innovative sustainability approaches.","Rather than create a detriment to the public good, the proposed project at 20 Sumner Road will result in public benefits in terms of supporting research and innovation in building sustainability, expanding site greenspace, improving the building’s accessibility, and investing in the historic resources of Cambridge. This project responds to the City’s policy goals for research, best practices and governance related to sustainability and climate change, as manifested in recent City initiatives including the “Getting to Net Zero Task Force” and the Cambridge Compact for a Sustainable Future. The 20 Sumner Road project is itself a research project, testing innovative ideas for retrofitting a residential wood-frame structure in an environmentally sustainable way.  This project directly responds to the Cambridge Growth Policy 50, which states that “The City should recognize the need for the major institutions to adapt and respond to changing circumstances to maintain their leadership positions in…research while recognizing, responding to and coordinating with City policy goals.”  The minor expansion of this house and research center represents a unique opportunity to respond to both the City’s and the University’s goals related to sustainability and climate change.In addition, the project replaces a large asphalt surface parking lot with nearly 4,000 square feet of new greenspace. The project will dramatically improve the accessibility of the building for persons with disabilities including the introduction of an accessible entrance, elevator, and toilet rooms.  Through this project, Harvard is investing in a 90+ year old building, and therefore preserving the character of Mid Cambridge.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The 20 Sumner Road addition can be readily accommodated on the site in a manner that respects the neighborhood character and does not impact the overall physical character of the lot or the surrounding neighborhood.  As noted above, because of the disproportionate effect of the FAR requirement on larger lots, the project will be consistent with the prevailing scale in the district and less than half of the average density of the district.  The proposed project will result in no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide public benefits of improved accessibility, increased open space, and sustainable building means and methods. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will permit the preservation of the nonconforming historic structure, while significantly improving its functionality and accessibility.","20 Sumner Road was originally constructed in 1923 as a single-family residence. Although the building has been in institutional use for more than four decades, it has seen limited physical modification from its original residential use. As a building in institutional use it must comply with many building and code requirements (including those related to accessibility) that would not normally affect structures in private residential use.  The layout, configuration and structural characteristics of what was originally a residential building create limitations on accommodating the upgrades and other modifications required for contemporary institutional uses. The site is located in a Residence B zoning district, which has an FAR that diminishes after the first 5,000 square feet, thus imposing stricter development provisions the larger the lot is. This lot is 43,922 square feet, as it combines four contiguous lots under common ownership, consistent with the requirement to merge such lots. The average lot size of all other lots in this Residence B zoning district is approximately 5,700 square feet, representing one-eighth the size of the 20 Sumner Road site, and the average FAR in the district is approximately 1.24, more than double the 0.61 proposed at this site. The resulting building will be consistent with the prevailing scale in the district and less than half of the average density of the district.The combination of the building’s physical characteristics, its continued utilization for institutional use, and the large lot size are conditions that do not generally affect properties in the Residence B zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,01/11/2017

The dormers on the south side of the house, which make one useable bedroom and oneless useable bedroom, have been awkwardly altered in a previous renovation. The Owner andPetitioner are asking for relief for the south dormer alteration to make two useable bedroomsinstead of one, and to rectify architecturally the look of that dormer. Also on the south side ofthe house there exists one of two entrances to the basement unit. The Owner would like toremove the dogshed-type enclosure around that entrance, consequently removing floor area,but would like to make a side/kitchen entrance with a small porch leading to the main floor ofthe house, and would like that porch to have a roof over it, thus adding floor area back. Literalenforcement of the Ordinance would disallow simple practical improvements by means ofmodest dormer alterations and a roofed porch.","Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good for thefollowing reasons: The proposed dormers conform to zoning district required sideyard setbacks,have no affect on required zoning district open space, and only minimally increase the FAR. Noadditional shadow is cast on, nor sky or fresh air obscured to adjacent properties; and no density isincreased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal. On the contrary, the proposal removes anillegal 3rd unit in the building and thus reduces density.","Relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent orpurpose of this Ordinance for the following reasons: the proposal does not adversely affect thehealth or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone’s property. In fact, therenovation of this property, and the proposal’s respect for the architecture of the building, ishealthy for the neighborhood and adjacent properties.","The hardship is owing to the following circumstances relating to the soil conditions, shape ortopography of such land or structures and especially affecting such land or structures but notaffecting generally the zoning district in which it is located for the following reasons: 75-77Norfolk Street was constructed as part of a row of Greek-Revival buildings in around 1844.The houses were constructed close to one another with little regard for property line setbacks,and the lots seem to have been composed with respect to some older houses that were sited inthe middle of land that became “blocks” later. At 75-77 Norfolk, an easement was negotiatedthrough the property to access one of these “older” buildings at 71-73 Norfolk Street, whichgives the impression that 75 Norfolk Street’s lot is smaller than it is. Nonetheless, the FARincrease sought by the Petitioner is minimal.","The proposed changes requiring a Special Permit in the City of Cambridge ZoningOrdinance are 1) the alteration of the roof over the rear section of the house, 2) moving awindow on the second floor of the house on the rear/northwest façade, and 3) increasingthe height of the basement door access on the same façade to a Code-height door. Therear section of the house is very close to the side property line, and also violates thecurrent required rearyard setback for the zoning district. The Ordinance will be metbecause the proposed roof alteration results in no change in gross floor area of thebuilding and no change in obscured sunlight or blue sky. The proposed change will also(beneficially) reduce the amount of water run-off from the rear section roof to theextremely narrow space between 75 Norfolk and its neighbor to the north, in that onlyhalf the roof will be pitching in that direction rather than the entire rear roof. The windowchange on the rear façade of the rear section of the house is a simple relocation of anexisting window, with no increase in opening size. The basement door change on thesame northwest façade is not increasing the visible door height: the top of the door willremain at the same level, the bottom of the doorway will lower below grade to achievethe height increase.","No more traffic will be generated nor patterns of access altered by this proposal. In fact,the reduction of the number of units in this house will decrease traffic and congestion inthe neighborhood.",The proposal does not affect the continued operation nor development of adjacent uses inthe neighborhood.,No nuisance or hazard causing detriment to any citizens of the City will be caused by thegranting of the proposal.,The proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district nor derogate from theintent of the Ordinance.,Cambridge,MA,11/05/2014

With the proposed addition, the total increase to volume of building since creation will be 16% below the 25% limit of Article 8.22.2.C.",Small footprint of the house and the townhouse configuration results in 40% of attic being within side setback.  The existing low roof ridge height severely limits occupiable use of attic beyond area of a new dormer.  Construction of the single 15' dormer allowed per Article 8.22.1.h will not accommodate bedroom with bathroom.,The existing townhouse development was constructed in acordance with Cambridge Zoning. The proposed construction maintains the pre-existing side setback of the property along the side of the existing building that abuts the adjacent townhouse. No new non-comformity is created by the proposed work.,The proposed dormer would allow the existing (single) family better use the property. No increase in traffic or congestion will result from the proposed work as no change in the number of occupants will occur.,The proposed dormer addition will have no impact on operation of adjacent residential buildings and parking garage. It will not alter daylight or interrupt views from adjacent properties.,The proposed work will benefit the welfare of the occupant by allowing additional room for family to live. The citizens of the city will not be able to view the proposed dormer construction within side setback because it is not visitble from a public way.,"The proposed construction within the side setback will not be visible from a public way, and only seen from the rear yard of two adjacent neighbors on either side of property. Property abuts a parking garage on rear lot line. Therefore the proposed construction will have no impact on visual integrity of neighborhood.",Somerville,MA,03/24/2017

This dormer is also intended to visually balance a new, as-of-right dormer of the same size, which we are adding over an existing stairwell to improve head clearance.The existing, non-conforming single-level addition was built by the previous owner to meet the functional needs of an elderly building occupant. The addition is currently on sonotube-pilings, with an insulated floor. We are concerned that the construction of this space will not have the longevity we are hoping to achieve, and could require additional renovation costs in the near future. We propose to rebuild this addition with the improved energy efficiency and pest-resistance of a full basement, and insulated foundation walls. We also would like to improve the character of this part of the building, to make it feel better-connected to the existing house. As renovations are currently proceeding within the rest of the house, costs of replacing the addition with a contractor on site will likely be less than those required in the future due to re-mobilization.","The new dormer will match and be symmetrical with another new dormer which we are adding as-of-right to improve head clearance at an existing stair; will meet the City's Design Guidelines for Roof Dormers; and will face the largest yard setback on the site and the rear of all abutting structures.The addition will nearly match in length and width an existing addition. The incremental addition to length and width is due to a small thickness (less than 3"") of continuous exterior insulation.The roof of the rebuilt addition will be lower than the ridge of the existing addition. Further, the addition will be built with higher quality materials, energy-efficient assemblies, and more consideration for historically-appropriate detailing than the existing addition.","The overall GSF of the structure will be decreased after completion of work as-of-right and, if granted, via the variance (primarily due to the removal of an existing three-season porch).

They are not creating any additional building lots and the site shall continue as garage use.The only other method to accomplish the transfer of the lots to Stephen D’Amato and to ourselves so that we would have off-street parking would be to demolish the existing structures and rebuild in a different configuration. This would necessarily result in a hardship, a very substantial economic risk to petitioners and to the neighborhood. Indeed, the most economical thing to do if petitioner were forced to demolish the existing structures would be to build a number of residential units, resulting in the loss of off-street parking. This is an outcome the zoning ordinance seeks to avoid.","Because the whole plan increases off-street parking and does not add additional residential dwelling and does not add further burden on municipal services. There will be no change to current configuration of the structures on the premises, which is currently preexisting nonconforming.","In addition, the proposal does not derogate from the intent of the ordinance, but in its terms is clearly consistent with its purpose and it does not effect a change in the district or adversely effect in any way nearby property.","The shape of the existing structures and their configuration on the land relate to and effect only locus and not the zoning district in general. The garages were constructed decades ago, they are well constructed and structurally sound, with as-is value. Their use and the continuance of off-street parking in Cambridge will lessen on-street parking. Further, petitioners cannot change the configuration of the structures or purchase additional frontage. The way to give adjoining property owners off-street parking without demolishing the existing structures and rebuilding (an obvious hardship of petitioners) is to convey the front portions as indicated. The remaining lot complies with the land area zoning requirements and does not increase the preexisting non-conforming use of the property Lot 2 will substantially remain in compliance with dimensional requirements, except that its frontage will be less than 50 feet as a result of the conveyance of Lots 1 and 3.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,04/28/2017

The appellant was not able to exercise the Variance granted for the reasons stated below.  We present this case again in the hopes that the BZA will re-grant this modest request.The Appellant, Wojciech Szczerba, was granted the Variance for the rebuilding of the covering of his 3rd floor deck roof on 6/12/14.  In the year following the granting of that variance there were circumstances in Mr. Szczerba’s life that precluded the completion of that work.  This included the death of his wife’s mother, and then the death of his mother in Europe.  In addition, his wife started of a new business, Lattitdenews.com, which took a great deal of time and money, and which eventually failed.  And his daughter changed schools, which was complicated.  There was then a misunderstanding about the length of time during which a Variance can be acted upon, which Mr. Szczerba believed to be 2 years, and not the allowable 1 year.  As the reasoning and arguments for the Variance request have not changed, we are including the text of the original variance request below.  Dates have been slightly modified to reflect the current time.Mr. Szczerba and his family are committed to staying in their home, and the granting of this Variance will further enhance that experience without derogating from the intent of the Ordinance.We believe that the request is still reasonable, and we hope that you will grant this Variance.(Original text of application follows)The Appellants and Owners of the property at 229 Lakeview Avenue, Wojciech Szczerba and Maria Balinska-Szczerba, bought this property two (now 5) years ago, in April of 2012.  They took what was a two-family structure in below average condition and, with the help of local tradesmen and a lot of their own sweat-equity, created a single family home for their family.  At the time they purchased the property, there was a partial roof over the existing second floor deck, but it was in poor repair.   As part of their as-of-right renovation they removed that small roof, but left the existing structure in place.  Now, after having lived in the house for 2 (5) years, the Owners are requesting a variance to rebuild that roof to provide adequate weather protection for the new door that was installed for what is now the master bedroom, as well as to protect the rear side of the house, with its various openings, from the weather.  The variance is necessary since the new G.F.A. exceeds the allowable by 98 square feet.  The variance is also required since the new roof will encroach on the left side setback by approximately two feet.The existing house is conforming in all respects, except with regard to the left side setback.  This side yard non-conformity is not uncommon in this neighborhood.  The current distance to the property line is approximately 4’-6”.  The proposed modest addition of the partial deck roof does not increase the existing side yard setback non-conformity.A literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would not allow this modest increase.  The placement of a roof over a portion of this 2nd floor deck would provide needed weather protection for the house, as well as a more desirable shading for the Owner.  And it would be unlikely that this covered area would be enclosed in the future since it would leave a remaining portion of the 2nd floor deck exposed that would be less than 3 feet in depth.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  The proposed modification is on the back of the house, and generally will not be seen by the public.  And the proposed modest roof will protect the building, adding to its longevity.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its purpose, among many things, “to conserve the value of land and building, including the conservation of natural resources…”  Specifically, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as this modest modification does not affect the general design of the house or the neighborhood, and will protect the building resource for a longer time.  In both a general and specific sense, the proposal neither nullifies nor derogates from the intent of purpose of the Ordinance.","The construction of this house in 1925 included a roof over the same area that the Owner’s wish to rebuild.  This provided the same protections from the elements and shading that the current Owners desire.  The downzoned conversion of this structure from a two family to a single family residence obviously modified the internal layout of the house.  The original design did not anticipate this type of legal conversion.  It is not unreasonable that this original roof be replaced, to provide the now master bedroom with this protection from the elements to the northeast.  The modest addition does not affect the zoning district in which it is located, as many of these structures in the B zone have similar roofs over rear decks.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,05/05/2017

The house was built and owned by James and Nellie Fenno in 1893. Behind the house and opening onto Fenno Street is a two-car wood frame garage built in 1924. The garage was not built on any kind of substantial foundation, nor does it have a proper floor. It is very lightly framed by today's standards (or even 1924 standards) and so it is leaning and pitching and requires stabilization. The Petitioner wishes to retain the garage because parking in the neighborhood and on Fenno Street particularly has become more difficult, but repairing it would entail lifting it, excavating for a 4' deep frost wall, and pouring a foundation below a raised and rickety building. The expense and trouble of doing the repair work this way has prompted the Petitioner to request zoning relief to re-construct the building.","The proposed demolition and reconstruction of the garage is an appeal to the common sense of the City that it is much easier and less expensive than the gymnastic repair process would be. The building is a long-accepted part of the fabiric of the neighborhood, and rebuilding it in its present form and size means that no additional shadow will be cast by it, and no density increased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal.","The proposal does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property.","The garage has been in its present location for 93 years. Thus, re-building it in exactly the same place and with exactly the same dimensions poses no threat to the zoning district. It is non-conforming for an accessory building currently in its height, which is 15'-11"" at its highest point, and in its disctance of 8.8' from the primary buulding, although it is 13.6' from the foundation of the primary building. When the structure was built there was not a limitation that an accessory garage for a single family house could be only for a single car, nor was there a distance requirement between the accessory and primary buildings. The basement of the house has an extremely short ceiling height of just about 6' below the joists and less than that below the beams, making storage there difficult to use and maneuver safely. Therefore, the Petitioner finds the second half of the garage to be a vital component of normal, daily house storage such as garden and house maintenance equipment, ladders, bicycles, and other items that might normally be kept in a basement.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,06/07/2017

The owner and his family occupy this home and have young children. The addition of the play room would allow them to better enjoy their home and lives in the city of Cambridge. This proposed play room would be built over an existing single story portion of the home. This single story portion contains the entrance to the basement level apartment and also the boiler room for the entire home. In order to build above this portion of the home, we need to relocate the entrance to the basement. The home is already non-conforming for it's rear yard and side yard (north side yard) setbacks. Construction of the addition would conform to the existing side and rear yard setbacks, but relocation of the entrance to the basement would increase the non-conformity of the rear yard setback. We are asking relief from the side and rear yard setbacks. We are additionally asking for relief from the front yard setback. It is non-conforming, however, no construction is proposed at the front of the home. Literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in a hardship to the owner as they would receive less enjoyment from their home. The owner could construct an addition and conform to the ordinance, but there would be additional hardship as this conforming addition would be more costly, block access to the rear yard, not be as attractive and would encroach on the parking area. Locating the play room addition, and basement access, to conform with required setbacks would encroach on the parking area and on the access to the first floor unit.","The proposed project - additions to an existing 2 family home - can be granted without detriment to the public good because: 1) the project does not change the use of the building or property 2) the project does not change the intensity of the use 3) the proposed project will improve the look of the existing building 3) the proposed project will not alter traffic patterns, emit noxious odors or sounds, cause a hazard to the population.","We are requesting relief from the side yard setback. The existing setback is 2.1 feet, and we would not be changing the side yard setback as part of this project. We are asking for relief from the rear yard setback. The existing setback is 14.3 feet and we would like to change the setback to 8.4 feet. This is a 5.9 foot change. The area of change from 14.3' to 8.4' conforms with the side yard setback, and would occupy only an additional 29.1 square feet of rear yard area beyond the 14.3 foot line. The proposed additions would improve the look of the home, changing a single story cement block addition into an addition that looks and feels more like the home it's attached to. The granting of relief would allow safe egress from the basement level apartment and would allow the play room addition to be constructed above the existing single story portion of the home. The home has an existing 4' front yard setback, which will not be changed as part of this project. We are requesting relief from the front yard setback, if required by the board for this project. Relief for this project can be grated without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because 1) the requested relief is small and is the result of the existing condition of the property 2) the proposed additions are a type of space that is enjoyed by many properties in the city and in the zone 3) the request for front yard setback is only recognizing an existing condition that will not be changed as part of this project. 4) the request for side yard setback is an existing condition that will not be changed as part of this project, it is only required in order to build to the same setback 5) the rear yard setback will be changed as part of this project but the area of change is only 29 total square feet (less than 1% of the lot area).","Hardship is owning to the existing shape of the structure on the lot. If the home was located with conforming setbacks, the addition would be permitted outright. Due to the pre-existing non-conforming nature of the side and rear setbacks, the most logical location of the addition is above the existing single story portion of the home.

The proposal does not increase lot coverage, or reduce open space.","The non-conformity of the existing house is directly related to teh size of the property. The old two-family house was built prior to the 1941 zoning bylaw revisions. These bylaw revisions put the structure into non-conformity due to it's undersized lot. In addition, the existing stair to the third floor was designed prior to the current Massachusetts Building Code, and is therefore non-conforming with regards to headroom.",The adjustment to the window locations will not further violate the non-conformity of the existing structure.

It does not meet room height requirements. This room has several problems. One is the owner is unable to use it for more than a storage area, though it has windows and the appearance of a 2nd floor room from the exterior. Another is that there is concern that shoveling heavy snow is difficult and has caused some leaking in the past. Fixing this roof, and making it habitable will have great impact on the owner's ability to inhabit an existing room with height too low.The owner seeks to raise the roof and use it as a master bath within the bedroom that from the inside  has complying height. The total space added is within existing footprint of the room, and as complying and usable space to outside walls of 74 GSF. The total interior area is approximately 54 SF. Because the interior spaace of the home is narrow, there is no other easy space to provide a full bathroom without losing closets or other storage areas or decreasing the size of existing small rooms further at the second floor. The total volume added is 174 cf. While the proposal is a gable roof to match the higher existing gable. in added area this would be equivalent to adding a flat roof of 2.3 feet higher than existing. While this is small relief, the granting will have substantial impact essentially adding a small but now usable room to the master bedroom.Additionally the proposal for the entire building is to remove 34 gross SF from the first floor within the living room to make room for a driveway to be able to access the existing garage. The net difference therefore is a net gain of only 40 Gross SF.","The room changes from the perspective of the public  enhance the appearance of the building, and complement the upper roof line matching slope with a new gable. There is also no real change to the neighborhood as granting this variance does not change the look nor feel of the district, nor from the interior increase the number of rooms, only the usability of this one small room.","There is no detriment to the public or the occupant for the requirested change. The room height added which creates new Gross Floor area inside, from the exterior as existing looks like a second floor. There will be no perception visually off adding a second floor room, simply a new roof line for this room with negligible addition in height and volume.","The building as originally built included this front room, which is essentially unuseable for other than storage, though looks like a second floor (it has windows on two sides). Additionally calculations from the Tax Assessor's Data Base appeaer to include this room as part of the FAR and GSF as 1664 SF. Field measurements confirm that the actual GSF is 1546 SF excluding the garage. and this 74 GFA room. While this margin of error is not atypical, it appears that this room and also the chimney area which is only a first floor space are included in this the total GSF in the database also at the second floor. Raising this roof will not look like an added room, as the current structure and shope of the building already appears to look like a habitable second floor space from the exterior.","1. The rear, roofed area is conververted from a covered porch connecting house to garage to a stair connecting house to garage. Complying floor area exists. In relocating a complying stair from first floor  within this existing floor area, the roof needs to be raised (angled to minimize volume) to meet headroom at the first floor, several feet higher than the garage and grade. Added volume due to height change is approximately 121 cubic feet. FAR is not impacted by this change.2. Windows are both enlarged and eliminated. Those within the south (left side), front and rear setbacks have some window changes which are within the yard setbacks. The small footprint at the front of the building contains two stacked rooms, proposed to be changed for interior renovations. This volume affects the south and front yard setbacks as follows, These windows provide additional privacy to owner and neighbors and result collectively in a net reduction of openings in setbacks: ~South (left) Setback: Remove 19 SF of existing windows, replace with 4 new windows totaling 16 SF.~Front Setback: Remove a total of 57 SF of existing windows, replace with 8 new windows totaling 32 SF.At the rear elevation, the house faces the patio and garden. Increasing visibility to this private outdoor space does not affect the intentions of the ordinance as these windows remain relatively invisible to neighbors but greatly enhance the connection between house and open space:~Rear Setback: Enlarge and existing window opening totaling 23 SFTotals of windows removed within all setbacks are 76 SF, and added are 71 SF. This is a net reducation of 5 SF.",The proposed special permits do not impact traffic in any way. No change.,"None of these proposals have a material affect on the adjacent uses. 1. The rear roof where it is connected to the garage and house is raised to create headroom at the house end to provide access from the first floor with 5 complying risers. This roof is then angled down toward the rear yard and just above the existing garage to be easily buildable. It will be barely visible from adjacent uses at grade, as the rear yard is fenced in, and will remain fenced to protect the owner's patio and garden. The total added volume is approximately 121 CF.2. The windows added will all be new and will complement the appeaarance of the building and neighborhood> New windows will match existing in style.","There is no detrmiment to the public or the occupant for any of the requested changes. The reloction of the rear stair actually corrects a non-complying condition of high risers and shallow treads that are unevenly distributed. The new stair meets code. The new windows provide more privacy at proposed bathrooms in the front and side yards where the setbacks are closer, and add connection to the house at the rear yard which does not affect adjacent uses, but connects the owner to the outdoor patio and garden spaces.","The proposed changes in the front room complement the neighborhood in creating new regularity in the windows on the grhee visible sides of the building at both stories. The proposed work in changing the window openings throughout is to accommodate interior renovtions as the owner anticipates aging in the house and is seeking a larger master bath, maneuvering room for kitchen and dining areas, and complying stairs that wil connect the house to the garage and rear yard. The rest of this neighborhood is also composed on small front, rear and side yards, and lots that are smaller than average. The changes are in keeping with the district as a whole.",Cambridge,MA,09/27/2017

They were planning to remove the rear deck when they realized that it is actually a roof over a portion of the original basement that protrudes from the main rectangle of the house footprint. In looking at historic photographs of the house in its original state, they saw that it used to have a one-story ell at the rear of the first floor that was undoubtedly part of what is now a curtailed kitchen area. The current house is very small, and southern light limited by a very tall Harvard Street-structure on the adjacent lot. Since the Owners were planning to renovate the kitchen and do it in such a way that some of the original character of the house be restored while trying to get as much precious southern light as possible into the first floor, they were moved to request a zoning variance in order to restore the missing first floor portion. The existing deck/roof structure is susceptible to leaking, and the addition would provide much needed kitchen pantry space.","The proposed ell addition is actually the restoration of an original portion of the house. Its scale, especially in relation to is looming neighbor to the south, is quite minimal. Very little additional shadow is cast by it onto any adjacent property since it is only one-story in height and faces south. No density is increased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal since it doesn't increase the quantity of living units in the neighborhood.","The proposal does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property.","The 1886 house was constructed with the rear ell that the Owners are requesting permission to re-build, and included a lasting, contiguous foundation below the ell. When it was constructed, there existed to the south of the house, at 345 Harvard Street, a double house from 1856 including a large lot of open space between the two houses. In 1961 the double house was razed and a 5-story apartment block was constructed that encroached sginificantly on that open land to within 10' of the rear property line separating the two lots. While the proposed addition violates the side and rear setbacks for a current C-1 district, it is a modest addition of only 6', utilizing an existing foundation, and the violation is minimal. The lot is an unusual double square shape, and the addition actually does conform to the rear yard setback taken from the very rear-most property line. The shape hints that land losses and acquisitions over the last 150 years have taken place that culminated in a house on an eccentric lot that meets some setbacks well and violates others. The Owners are hoping to respectfully and minimally increase the size of a small kitchen, eliminate a problematic and unwanted deck, and make changes that have value as historic restoration of an original structure.","The proposed window changes on the west side of the house increase the width of one double-hung window by 8"" and move it northward by 2', and decrease the height of another double hung window by 15"" while keeping it in the same location.  The net square footage of glass remains almost the same in the proposal as exists there now.  Therefore, no burdensome light will be increased for abutting neighbors.","No traffic will be generated nor patters of access altered by this proposal, thus there will be no substantial change in the character of the neighborhood and no hazardous congestion created by it.","No nuisance or hazard causing detriment to the health safety, or welfare of the occupants nor the citizents of the City of Cambridge will be created by this proposal.","The proposal would not impair the integrity of the district nor the adjoining district, nor would it in any other way derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.",,Cambridge,MA,07/12/2017

The Owner was also granted a Special Permit for a Reduction of Parking.After that BZA hearing and approval, a more extensive investigation of the building condition revealed several issues.  Primary was the fact that there is an active water table just below the existing basement slab.  The initial plans of digging down the basement space down to provide for a more usable basement storage area had to be reconsidered.  One option would have been to dig down below the water table and to install a waterproof foundation, with a 24 hours groundwater pumping to the storm drain.  This proved both prohibitively expensive, and was rejected by the Cambridge DPW.  In conversations with the DPW, they described that this area at Columbia and Harvard Streets is already underserved by the City stormwater system, and therefore highly susceptible to flooding in the near future.  In order to work around the high water table, we discussed with the DPW the possibility of leaving the existing foundation, and raising the building to avoid the inevitable flooding of the 1st floor retail spaces.  The DPW was supportive of this proposal.  Therefore we are proposing leaving the existing foundation in place, which has been determined by our structural engineer to be stable and suitable for reconstruction of the upper building and living units.  However the removal of the building above grade triggers a new set of required zoning  relief that is beyond what was granted by the BZA on October 11, 2018.  We are proposing to rebuild the existing structure, plus the residential units granted by the BZA on 10/11/18, with the new first floor level at approximately 24” above the current first floor sidewalk grade.  This will ensure protection from inevitable future flooding.  This new proposal will require the following zoning relief as follows:•	Variance for commercial use in the C-1 zone•	Variance for setbacks•	Variance for FAR, as per the earlier 10/11/18 BZA approval•	(SP) for parking relief, as per the earlier 10/11/18 BZA approvalIn addition, the Owner will be applying to the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board (AAB) for a variance to create a handicap ramp that is not at the primary access points.  That Variance is in process.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship, since groundwater was found just below the surface of the existing basement slab.  It is not financially possible to lower the basement level to provide adequate storage space.  The solution is to raise the level of the first floor.",Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good because the residential use is consistent with the multifamily properties along Columbia Street and the maintaining the ground floor retail use (Camie's Bakery) will continue to be an asset to community and activate the street-scape.,"The requested relief will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because the requested relief will result in the same building that was approved by the BZA on October 11, 2018.  It was for that earlier application that the community was is great support of the project.  The requested project will result in a fully upgraded building, as well as the much needed addition to the Cambridge housing stock.","The hardship is owing to the building being constructed just above a high water table, and the fact that the area is prone and susceptible to flooding in the near future (according to the Cambridge DPW).  The existing condition of the existing structure is poor, and modification will be more expensive that a reconstruction.",With the requested Special Permit the requirements of the Ordinance can be satisfied.,"Traffic generated or patterns of access or egress will not cause congestion, hazard or substantial change in the neighborhood character.  All requested zoning relief replicates the project approved by the BZA on October 11, 2018, with the rebuilding of the existing retail, and the creation of 2 residential units above.The Columbia Street Corridor contains mixed use properties that enliven the street and add much needed neighborhood amenities to the Port Neighborhood.","The continued operation or development of adjacent uses would not be adversely affected because the proposed uses replicated the previous commercial uses, as well as the previously approved residential, which will be of a scale and character consistent with the surrounding properties.","No nuisance or hazard will be created to the detriment of the health, safety and/or welfare of the occupants of the proposed use or citizens because the residential dwellings will conform to the setbacks and other dimensional regulations where possible.","The intent and purpose of the Ordinance is to promote the highest and best use of Land throughout the City.

Like much of East Cambridge, the house is sited with close-to-zero property line setbacks, and thus has almost no outdoor space. The Owners have opted to forego their car parking area at the left of the house, abutting Windsor Street, so that their daughter has a playyard, and their car is left on the street. But it is a very compact area, measuring about 12'x17', abutted by a house directly to the south that blocks much sun, and will not accomodate even a modest variety of outdoor activities but especially isn't conducive to gardening. Unusually, 315 Windsor Street is a two-story structure with a flat roof, and therefore the potential exists to have a garden/porch on top of the second floor. Our City's Zoning Ordinance requirement fr minimum Open Space percentages recognizes not only an urban fabric breathing room but also the benefits to human health and welfare of time spent outdoors, which is why decks and porches count as Open Space. In Cambridge it is prohibitively expensive, of course, to try to purchase abutting land or to lop off sections of one's own house to acquire a yard. These limitations, and the dearth of public parks in East Cambridge, have prompted the Owners to request zoning relief to utilize the roof as a garden/porch, accessible by building a stair over their existing 1st to 2nd floor stair, protected by a headhouse.","The proposed rooftop garden and porch casts minimal additional shadow on the abutting properties, and is set back substantially from the Windsor Street facade of the house. Taking advantage of the flat roof is part of a long tradition of people carving out ways to be outside in a dense city, and because this proposed ""yard"" would belong to a small single-family house with little potential to house multiple disruptive tenants, the proposed garden would be a place of respite and quiet. No density is increased nor traffic generated due to the granting of the proposal.","The proposal not only does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property, it helps to come closer to satisfying the Open Space requirements of the district.","The house at 315 Windsor was originally constructed at 93 Hampshire, and was moved by pivoting it 90 degrees in 1876. At the time that it was constructed, the land it now occupies was likely its own yard. The year the house was moved, the building that is now at 93 Hampshire Street was built, and 315 Windsor was hemmed into its own subdivided lot resulting in almost no exterior space. The lot is undersized for the zoning district in which it is located, and the house footprint doesn't meet current Ordinance setback requirements. Therefore, the Owners are looking to take advantageous of the fortuitous architecture of the house, the flat roof, to regain a garden and fresh air space.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,07/14/2017

The lot is a double lot consisting of 10,000 square feet. The abutting lots are all 5,000 square feet. The applicants recently moved to Cambridge and are in the process of remodeling the dwelling. Presently, upon entering from the porch, the entryway is so narrow that two people have to enter single file and there is no room to put boots or coats in the winter. This results in snow and mud being tracked up the stairs. Moreover, there is presently no heat source in the entryway which makes it very cold in the winter. A literal enforcement of the ordinance would prevent the conversion of the present porch entryway into a mudroom and thereby deprive the owners of a reasonable amenity and thus involve a substantial hardship. Modern considerations of energy, cost, sensible layouts and neighborhood compatibility and style are all met by this proposal.",No detriment to the public good will be caused by the addition of this proposed mudroom. A review of neighboring entryways shows that the redesign will be more in keeping with the architectural features in the neighborhood as well as restoring the original architectural integrity of the dwelling.  The public good is advanced by modernizing old building to be architecturally consistent with neighboring buildings and by improving the existing housing stock to conform to modern living standards.,"The applicants wish to make their home modern and comfortable. The lot and dwelling were created long before the modern zoning code was enacted. The purpose of the Ordinance is to have a rational plan for the arrangement of lots and buildings within the City. While the applicants cannot alter the position of the dwelling on the lot, they are committed to the goal of first class, attractive housing in this C-1 Zoning District. There will be no impact on traffic as a result of this addition. 	The applicants respectfully request relief for this proposal. They believe it will be an enhancement to the building and to the neighborhood.","The variance requested is due to the existing configuration of the building on the lot with regard to required setbacks that are substantially less than is permitted in a C-1 Zoning District.

The lot also contains a structure at the rear which has been used as a studio and a two bay garage.  This property is in the B zone, and thus allows a maximum of 1 unit (2.500 SF lot/D.U.).  The Owner is performing a Deep Energy Retrofit of the house, and will create a Zero Energy Home.  The Owner currently has an as-of-right building permit for the renovation of the existing house, with a modest addition of less than 10% of the house GFA.  This permit also includes a complete replacement of the foundation.  For the purpose of this application, it is the pre-permitted house which represents the “Existing Conditions” as part of the request sought is a special permit for an addition greater than 10% of the original GFA.The proposed structure will require two reasonable variances, as follows:1.	Setback Variance: To extend further into the 7’6” required setback on the left side of the building.  The Owner is creating a highly energy efficient home.  To achieve this, he will add approximately 2” of exterior insulation to the entire envelope of the house.  This will make a non-conforming left side setback (currently at 3.2’) more non-conforming (at 3.03’).  While the CZO, Article 22, section 43.2 allows for the addition of up to 4” of additional insulation to achieve greater energy efficiency, it does not allow that to happen if the resulting setback is less than 7’2”.  Therefore, the Owner needs a variance to add that additional 2” of exterior insulation, as the resulting setback will be 3.03’.  This is a reasonable request given that the energy efficiency of the house will be greatly increased, and given that the overall GFA or usable interior space will not be increased.2.	Open Space Variance: While the open space, especially usable open space, is being greatly increased, the combined Open Space for the entire project is less than required for a lot of this size, and a variance is requested for relief from this requirement.Variance 1: A literal enforcement of the ordinance would not allow construction within the left side setback.  But as the addition of 2 more inches of insulation will allow for the creation of a significantly more energy efficient home, without increasing any additional GFA, this request is reasonable.Variance 2: A literal enforcement of the ordinance would not allow for the open space to be configured as it is proposed.  However, the existing open space is only 12.9% (which includes no usable open space) which is being increase to 29.6%, a dramatic increase.  Relief from the Ordinance requirement, given the narrow dimensions of the lot and the configuration of the structures on the lot, is reasonable.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  To the contrary, the creation of a new, well-built living unit adds positively to the Cambridge housing stock.  And the creation of a net zero residential structure achieves the goals of the City well in advance of their 2022 goal for 1-3 unit residential construction.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its mission.  The proposed structure achieves many goals of the ordinance including, “…to provide adequate light and air…including the conservation of natural resources…”.  For these Variance requests, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as these modest requests positively affect the habitants living in the structure.In both a general and specific sense, the proposed requests neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","In each case, the hardship is owing to the configuration of the structures on the lot, and the size and shape of the lot.Variance 1: The lot, at 40’ wide, does not meet the Ordinance requirement of 50’ in width.  Thus the narrow dimensions of the lot, and the placement of the house and driveway, create the existing non-conformity. Variance 2: The configuration of the buildings on this narrow lot create the Open Space non-conformity.  The Owner, in the rehabilitation of this property, is greatly increasing the combined open space, getting significantly closer to the Ordinance requirement of 40%.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,07/12/2017

All buildings on the lot are of steel and masonry construction and are in institutional educational use.,"Summary of Requested VarianceThe Harvard Kennedy School (“HKS”) is nearing completion of construction on a development project that will add three additional buildings and establish new and improved pedestrian access points to its campus. To serve the campus’ identification and wayfinding needs resulting from this new development, HKS has developed a comprehensive signage program. The first phase of the signage program focuses primarily on the new additions to the campus and major campus entry points. A subsequent phase will address signage on existing buildings. The proposed signage program seeks to appropriately identify new additions to the campus, clarify wayfinding for students, faculty, staff and visitors to HKS, and establish a consistent design aesthetic for a variety of signage types.The proposed signage included in the variance request includes a total of 21 new signs which are subject to zoning requirements. Signage which is internal to the campus (not visible from a public way) and signs necessary for public safety and convenience have been certified by the Cambridge Community Development Department as exempt from zoning restrictions.Upon completion of the new development all of the existing HKS campus buildings will be interconnected above grade. For the purposes of zoning compliance, the interconnected complex of buildings will be treated as a single building. Because the HKS campus is located in a Residence C-3 zoning district, signage for non-residential uses is limited to two non-banner signs per building and a total area of 30 sq. ft. per building. To adequately serve the identification and wayfinding needs of this multi-building educational campus, a variance is required to permit the number of proposed signs, height of free-standing signs (campus maps) and their locations (in relation to required setbacks).A literal enforcement of the provisions of CZO 7.16 would permit a maximum of two signs and a total of 30 sq. ft. of signage for the entirety of the main HKS campus, despite being comprised of multiple buildings and having over 600 ft. of street frontage. This severe limitation would prevent Harvard from adequately identifying all key entrances to the HKS campus, and from providing clear directional information to key campus buildings that are frequented by visitors. Such enforcement would create a significant hardship by impacting campus operations (for example the lack of clear identification of locations of receipt of mail and deliveries, and for emergency response). It would also make wayfinding more difficult for students, faculty and staff who are on the campus daily, and the many visitors to the campus including those attending the many public events hosted by HKS.","The requested variances are necessary to address the need for a clear and coordinated signage program to serve new and existing development on the HKS campus. The proposed signage program will significantly improve wayfinding for the campus’ multiple users which includes large numbers of the public who visit the campus on a regular basis. In addition, the campus’ appearance will be improved by providing a consistent design aesthetic for its public face. Therefore, the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public good, but rather will provide a public benefit by improving wayfinding and the visual character of the campus.","The requested variance will allow the placement of adequate signage to better identify campus entrances and to guide visitors to specific buildings and facilities, which is consistent with the CZO’s assertion that the public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available.The requested relief for the number of signs allowed, height (campus maps) and sign locations (with respect to building setbacks) will allow adequate identification and wayfinding signage at multiple campus entry points. The variances being sought are consistent with those granted by the Board of Zoning Appeal for recent signage proposals at other Harvard campuses including the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and the Harvard Divinity School. The requested relief is unique to the characteristics of a multi-building educational campus with multiple access points, therefore granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the purpose of the Ordinance.","The Harvard Kennedy School campus has developed over several decades to its current configuration as an interconnected multi-building educational complex surrounding an open central courtyard, encompassing an entire city block. The campus has over 1,200 feet of frontage on streets and other public ways and five key entry points or gateways to the campus. The campus’ seven interconnected buildings have three unique street addresses and provide additional campus access points via multiple building entries. The number of possible points of entry, and the relationship between major campus gateways and specific building locations or addresses makes wayfinding unclear for many visitors to the campus.Additionally, the HKS campus is host to many activities that bring a significant number of visitors to the campus on a regular basis, most notably public events at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. In addition HKS sponsors multiple lectures, presentations, discussions and special events across its campus on a daily basis, many of which are open to the general public.The physical and use characteristics of this multi-building educational campus (the number of campus access points, multiple buildings and street addresses, and uses with high public visitation), requires sufficient signage to adequately identify key campus access points and to guide visitors to key campus destinations. The need for greater flexibility in the signage permitted for non-residential uses in the Residence C-3 zoning district is unique to the function of a multi-building educational campus, and is not typical of other uses in the Residence C-3 zoning district.",,,,,,Cambrige,MA,07/28/2017

The grant of this special permit meets the requirements of the Ordinance. The space that is the subject of this special permit application is used by the Boston Dog Company (hereinafter the ""Company"") for pet care and related services (such as dog day care, dog grooming, dog training, and retail sale of dog related products). The Company also utilizes one garage space at the Premises for dog training.","The Company offers a pick-up and drop-off service for their clients by utilizing a pet taxi to pick up the pets from their homes and return them once their services are complete. This greatly reduces the need for parking on the street. The Company already uses this service here and at their 535-545 Cambridge Street location. Their pet taxi service is estimated to have decreased CO2 emissions greatly. For clients that do not utilize the pet taxi, there are two parking spaces (one garage space and one outdoor space) at the Premises. Clients typically park for an average of 3-4 minutes when picking up or dropping off their dogs and virtually all need for parking is for pick up and drop off. The site is within a 16 minute walk of the Alewife MBTA train station and approximately an 11 minute walk to the Davis Square MBTA train station. There are also many bus routes available at a bus stop approximately 20 yards away. The space used by the Company is in keeping wiht the established neighborhood character, as this space was previously used as a retail store called Childhood Days, which sold children's clothes, toys, etc. on consignment. Also, the Company operates a dog product related ""farmer's market"" out of the garage space on weekends. This is something other businesses in the area do and seems well-received by the community.",Adjacent uses are similar to this proposal. This will be a continuation of a common land pattern in this neighborhood.,"This proposal will advance the objective of the Zoning Ordinance, which is generally to promote service of the needs of the community. The Company has customers who live in the area and had requested the Company open this location. Thus, it will not impair the integrity of the district, adjoining district, or otherwise derogate from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance.","In 2015, the City of Cambridge issued 3,205 dog licenses.

Additionally the proposed four unit townhouse is substantially smaller (less unit and lower heights) than the BA-2 zoning permits and was designed in concert with the abutting neighbors as part of a rezoning (See Stern Petition # Ordinance #1384) specifically to eliminate the ground floor retail requirement allowing for a lower building that meets the street consistent with the other developments along Massachusetts Avenue. Without relief Petitioner would suffer substantial financial hardship as well as create a front façade that is inconsistent with urban design principles that focus on activating streetscapes and having buildings coplanar with other building on Massachusetts Avenue.,Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good because the proposed four unit building is consistent with the lower scaled residential neighborhood to the North and West of the property and was also the result of an extensive neighborhood design process evidenced by the rezoning and Memorandum of Understanding.,Desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance because the proposed setback in consistent with the building street scape along Massachusetts Avenue and is the most rational use of land for this site.,"The hardship is owing to the unique location of the business district abutting a residential district on Massachusetts Avenue which only occurs in one other area on Massachusetts Avenue (between Roseland Street and Forest).

Note: sheds shown on enclosed plot plan have been removed.,,,,,"The Petitioner, Douglas Yoffe, purchased the townhouse dwelling located at 126-5 Oxford Street, Cambridge (the “Property”) at a foreclosure sale in April of 2013.  The Property is currently in a deteriorated and unlivable condition, and requires major renovation, including the rebuilding of the South wall (the right-side, as viewed from Oxford Street) of the townhouse, due to extensive wood rot, deteriorated windows, and improper framing, all as documented in the report of the Petitioner’s structural engineer (see attached Engineering Inspection Report by Sean Fennell, PE, or Fennell Engineering, Inc.).  As described in the Report, the existing structure is unique and problematic in several respects, resulting in it being inadvisable to rebuild the structure as currently built.  Mr. Yoffe has developed a proposal to renovate the townhouse in such a way as to remedy the structural problems which have caused its current deteriorated condition: specifically, Mr. Yoffe seeks to extend the A-frame pitched roof line to the South wall, thereby eliminating the problematic “clerestory” with upper level windows, to square off the South wall of the building (expanding a 13 foot portion of the wall out 3 feet), and to modify the rear egress stairway.  On the interior, he seeks to remove the third floor loft/office space and build a smaller bath in its place, and reconfigure the use of space within the building without increasing the gross floor area.  Since these renovations will result in a modification to a townhouse development that was originally built under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, Section 11.1, any such modification, even though it does not increase a pre-existing non-conformity  on the lot, requires a special permit pursuant to Section 11, subsection 11.15 (c)The exterior changes proposed meet requirements of the Ordinance with respect to roof height, setbacks and usable open space on the lot.  Specifically, extending the A-frame pitched roof line to the South wall will not result in an increase in roof height.  And the squaring off of the South wall of the building (a proposed 3 foot expansion of a 13 foot portion of the South wall), and modification of the rear egress stairway, do not result in an encroachment into side yard setbacks, nor a significant diminishment of open areas on the lot.  The interior changes (reconfiguring of space within the interior) result in a modest decrease in the gross floor area, and thus decrease the pre-existing non-conformity of the Property.  But for the fact that the townhouse was originally permitted under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, Section 11.1 (pursuant to which any modifications require a Special Permit under Section 11.15 (c)), the petitioner would be allowed to perform such work as of right.","The petitioner’s requested changes to this single family townhouse will not have any impact on traffic or access or egress to the Property, and will not result in an increase in congestion or other substantial change in the established neighborhood.","Mr. Yoffe’s proposed renovation will not adversely affect the operation of or development of adjacent uses.  The Property is bounded on both sides by large structures; the south wall faces a much larger apartment building.   The proposed exterior changes, with its modest increase in the front wall surface facing the street, will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor impair the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to abuttors.","The proposed renovations will not be harmful to the health, safety and/or welfare of the occupant of the Property or other Cambridge citizens, but will, to the contrary, greatly improve a currently dilapidated, vacant building, and remedy the structurally defective condition of the Property for future occupants of the townhouse.","The proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district, as it requests a modest change and improvement to an existing single family home in an already dense, residential, heavily-traveled neighborhood of Cambridge.",Boston,MA,01/29/2014

The second floor apartment has one egress door and one wrought iron fire escape which is accessed through an existing double hung window. The fire escape is a vertical ladder which, for half its height, has no fall protection. The attachments of the fire escape have over the years damaged the existing structure of the building, allowing water entry and compromising framing and sheathing (please refer to existing photographs). During a fire, the wrought iron ladder could become very hot, making it difficult to hold onto the ladder while climbing down. The owners would like to provide a more robust, safer and more easily accessed and maintained second means of egress for the upstairs apartment by installing a new exterior egress stair (see plans and elevations) in lieu of the iron fire escape. The proposed stair would be accessed via a new door from the second floor level and would bring occupants to grade. The stair construction would not add to gross floor area, but would encroach on the yard requirements of Article 5. Since the existing wrought iron fire escape must be removed to allow repair of the existing wall construction, an improvement to the existing egress configuration is proposed. Reinstalling the existing fire escape after repairs would perpetuate the maintenance issues that have caused the current damage, and would perpetuate the danger posed by the vertical ladder to occupants trying to escape during an emergency. Reinstalling the existing iron fire escape in order to minimize impingement on yard setbacks exposes the owner to unacceptable risk, not only to the safety of the owner and owner's family, but as a potential future lessor of the dwelling unit.The proposed stair configuration is the most compact layout possible, minimizing the footprint on the lot and maintaining the largest and most usable configuration of the remaining open space on the lot.","Required setbacks protect privacy and access to fresh air, light and views. The eastern abutter is a church, the rear wall of which faces the subject property. The southern abutter is well over 40' away from the south (rear) property line, which is twice the minimum rear setback for the district. In addition, views to the proposed stair from the south would be screened by the existing trees and shed on the abutter's property. The west abutter has no line of sight to the proposed intervention. The proposed stair is for emergency egress only and would be occupied only infrequently. The privacy of neighboring residents would be only minimally impacted at those moments when the stair was in use, though, as mentioned above, there is no privacy need at the east abutter's rear wall, and the south abutter is well screened by vegetation.","The zoning ordinance is intended, broadly, to balance the pressures of economic development with the needs of individual residents. While development standards are drawn from the existing character of a neighborhood as a whole and are intended to protect that character, it may be that individual atypical properties in a neighborhood will be disadvantaged by the application of these standards, when other, more typical properties will not. The intent of the Ordinance is certainly not to prevent individual owners from improving the safety and security of their properties. In fact, by doing so, owners reinforce the purpose of the Ordinance as stated in the Preamble: ""to...conserve health; to secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other danger; ...[and] to conserve the value of land and buildings... .""","The lot is less than a quarter of the minimum size required for the zoning district. This results in an extremely constricted layout, with near zero setbacks on two sides and only one conforming side yard. Were the lot dimensions conforming, with a minimum width of 50' as required, this same stair configuration would be easily allowable without impinging on any of the requirements of Article 5. The building footprint, lot layout and deed predates the effective date of the zoning ordinance, and does not result from any action of the owner.","The proposed change (modified window/door locations on side and rear facades) will not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure. The structure as modified for the new windows/doors would not be in further violation fo Articles 5 or 6, nor will it be increased in area or volume by more than 25%","The changes to window and door locations requested in this application would not change traffic patterns or affect congestion. They would not affect established neighborhood character because all work is to match the style of the existing mansard Victorian house, and most changes are not visible to the majority of the neighborhood, being on the side and rear facades.",There is no change to the proposed use. The special permit petition is to move certain door and window openings on the side and rear facades which would have no effect on adjacent uses. The reconfiguration is to accommodate the new interior layout of the dwelling units.,The window/door changes are at the request of the principal occupants of the building in question. The changes would have no effect on the health and safety of City residents in general.,"The relocated window and door openings would not have any effect on the integrity of the district or surrounding districts. The proposed changes support the intent of the Ordinance because they allow the most efficient layout of the building, ensuring the best access to light and air for occupants without changing the character of the structure as seen from the street and surrounding lots.",Quincy,MA,10/04/2017

A sloped roof over the landing is needed to provide shelter of the occupants from weather, in particular any falling objects, such as heavy snow or ice from the steep hip roof two stories above. The proposed renovation is lowering the building gross floor area by eliminating the roof over a second story covered porch (88 sq.ft.) to allow for greater access to light and air. In exchange, to protect the new side entry door from the elements of weather, the covered entry landing will add back only 18 sq.ft. for a net total deduction of 70 gross square feet.","The proposed side entry has been designed to be modest in size in order to meet building code requirements for a stair landing.

This non-conformity is consistent with the neighborhood pattern and is the case for most of the houses on the street. The steep hip roof of the house provides for an unsafe walking space along the driveway as heavy snow and ice do easily fall down from two stories above. To provide shelter, the proposed roofed stair landing protrudes minimally into the side yard setback by only 16"".

The additional 55 s.f. resulting from the dormer on the 3rd floor will allow for an additional bedroom. The owner would like to dormer the roof to provide for a growing family and there not being adequate height clearance in the attic space. Dormer will provide windows, natural ventilation, needed height and allow for a shower for upstairs so as not have to go downstairs to use joint bathroom.Stairs:Current egress from 2nd floor is through exit window.  Additional stair and egress area provides a safer means of exiting from 2nd floor.  There is a slight encroachment into the side setback (still within the building footprint). The owner would like to have safe egress from the 2nd floor dwelling unit and access to the outdoor space. The narrow lot size, existing lot-line construction and small lot area provide little conforming area to work within.","Dormer: Several of the adjacent property owners already have dormer additionsThe dormer is within the current footprint, adheres the Cambridge dormer guidelines, is consistent with abutting dormers in the row and will have no impact (light or privacy) on the abutting residences who support the plans. It will not be visibly noticeable from the street and is consistent with abutting dormers. With that being said, angles from which the dormer is visible, will reveal a fluid extension of the existing structure. Stair: The new stair/egress area remains within the current sideyard setback - situation is not made worse. The proposed egress will secure safety from fire and provide better privacy screening for owner and neighbors. All other houses within the row have larger decks leading to back or side yards.","The requested relief is well within precedents already set by the Ordinance at other properties, including neighboring and adjacent properties. eing such a modest alteration, the dormer's integration into the building would not substantially derogate the intent of this ordinance. It will only be adding on 56 SF, it will not add more occupancy, its intent is merely to maximize head room and allow for a bathroom in an existing bedroom. It will provide more light and air.The proposed egress is located against the existing house, provides additional privacy, secures safety from fire, provides more light and air, and promotes outdoor use and access to the back yard.","The existing 2-family structure is an attached row house with near lot line construction on three sides with little room for egress. The structure is currently a non-conforming structure and therefore any modification requires zoning relief. The small size and dimensions of the existing lot and the townhouse configuration provide limited room for expansion within existing ordinance requirements.Adding the proposed dormer will not affect the site whatsoever. Existing soil, topographical and shape conditions will remain intact. It is top of the building that will be integrated with a tasteful and non-offensive dormer.",The proposed stair/egress area does not exceed current encroachment of the building into the side yard setback,The addition is in the rear of the property and will not cause any change to the front of the building,"The proposed stair/egress area does not exceed current encroachment of the building into the side yard setback, thus the existing situation is not made any worse due to the proposed addition.  The design includes a privacy screen thus further mitigating the impact on the neighboring property",The proposed stair/egress area improves the safe exiting of residents of the proposed use.

The family has 3 children with a regular bedroom and 2 narrow rooms with small closets. There is also no guest room or study area beyond the dining niche in the kitchen. The lack of a mudroom means the front door of the house opens directly into the living room, which basically becomes a mudroom along one wall and a couch on the opposing wall.  By adding a 3rd floor, a 3rd child's bedroom and a study can be created.  Additionally a basement though costlier than a first floor extension can be added to create the missing mudroom, mechanical room and basement storage in the below grade shed for all the bicycles and sports gear.","The proposed massing matches the abutters height, roofine, and roof slopes to match the rowhouses on either side.  This will preserve the rowhouse vernacular and ensure the propsed 3rd floor is no more detrimental to the abutters.  The basement level shed also ensures the rear yards vista across the rowhouses is not infringed on.  The front yard at grade shed is also relocated below grade to provide a more open vista across the rowhouse lots.","The massing for the front facade and the rear facade remains the same as abutting properties which are typical 3 story, 1 and 2 family homes as the zoning ordinance intended. The basement and below grade shed also ensure the compact scale intended by the rowhouses is preserved. This is an even more compact scale than the typical 1 or 2 family in the district whose first floor is 3-4 feet above grade. Such houses with much steeper roof slopes and higher roof ridge abut the rear of the rowhouse lots. Note see site S-1 drawing for context.","As is typical in rowhouses, this lot is extraordinarily narrow @ 19.2 ft. The narrowness results in a combined sideyard setback that leaves no buidable area.   The narrow lots were created by eliminating the typical 7-8 ft sideyard that runs the length of the entire lot.  For an average 40 ft wide lot this would mean 40% reduction in the lot size if it is crunched into rowhouse lots.  Subsequently, the 3-storey abutting rowhouses have a 108% FAR even though their footprints are much smaller than a typical tenement house.

Rather the roof deck would create an increase in useable open space and better marketability of the unit to long term families to use as an owner occupied unit rather than a short term rental if it remains a 2 bedroom without outdoor space and essential storage.,The intended massing of the zoning district is 3 stories so the small 2nd story penthouse for one unit that is roughly 1/6 of the much larger one story 6 unit building has very little impact on the increased massing.  The setback of the penthouse also helps preserve the appearance of a one story converted industrial building.,The building is a previous industrial one story structure.  The development of the unit was restricted to the main floor with no basement because of the possible legal costs to rectify environmental conditions of subgrade soil of the industrial buiding was too much of a hardship for the original development to address. The lack of exterior open space and a children's room can be resolved by adding a roof deck and penthouse. The penthouse would also compensate for the loss of floor area on the compact first floor when adding the staircase. The proposed building height would only be 2 stories in a 3 story allowable district. Making the existing setbacks more detrimental are also avoided by keeping the penthouse setback from the parapet of existing first floor.,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,Cambridge,ma,10/11/2017

Currently, the rubber roof under the existing roofdeck is in need of repair, as it leaks into the first floor unit. In order to repair the rubber roof, it is likely that the existing roofdeck would need to be completely removed. Additionally, there is an interior enclosure, likely add during renovations in 1996, which may also be impeding repair of the rubber roof. The roofdeck and interior enclosure will likely need to be removed to replace the rubber roof, and its details and age may even be contributing to the leaks. Further, in an effort to better prevent future leaks, the Owner would like to add a roof over the roofdeck itself, which will keep rain and snow from sitting on the roofdeck and accelerating its deterioration. Presently, the floorboards of the deck are in an advanced stage of rot due to exposure. Preventing the Owner from building the roof will ensure that the Owner will just have to replace the roofdeck soon again, because of exposure to weather.  Due to the positioning of the home relative to prevailing winds, the current deck traps blowing snow resulting in heavy accumulations.  The resulting snowbank creates an ice dam which causes water to overrun the rubber roof’s flashing.  A slanted roof would fully mitigate the snow buildup and associated leaks.   b.	Currently, the rear exterior steps into the house are exposed to the weather; during winter, they become coated with ice and snow, and become a serious slip hazard. The slope of the existing roof sheds melting snow and ice directly onto the steps.  Building this roofdeck will allow these stairs to be protected from weather. c.	Currently, the rear of the house, with the flat roofdeck, is not in the same architectural character as the rest of the house. Adding the roof will tie the rear of the house together more harmoniously with the rest of the house; the Owner is planning on being a long-term occupant and is interested in adding positively to a neighborhood with strong architectural character with this renovation. d.	Currently, the deck is not usable in times of high/direct sun, or if there is any precipitation; adding the roof to the deck will ensure it is usable in more circumstances.  The existing interior enclosure with the flat roof is poorly insulated, so it becomes very hot during summer days.  e.	Currently, a toilet vent pipe is situated in the corner of the deck.  If winds blow in the wrong direction, the deck may be exposed to vent odors.  The roof will ensure that gasses from the vent do not  drift onto the deck.  f.	Currently, the design of the roofdeck incorporates a gap space between the floorboards and the rubber roof below to allow for drainage since the deck is exposed.  A family of five racoons has moved into the gap space, creating a risk for disease and other problems.  The addition of a slated roof above the deck will enable the owner to effectively reduce / seal this space, eliminating the risk of future infestation.","i.	The roofdeck already exists, so this application is not adding a use or space that has not already existed in this space for some years. Adding the roof will actually make the deck more private, and less visible or its occupants less audible from neighboring properties or the street. ii.	The roofdeck is not in violation of any setbacks, meaning it’s not any closer to the neighbors’ houses than the existing roofdeck. It is adding GFA to the property, but only because covered roofdecks must be counted toward GFA, but unocovered decks, which is what the deck is now, do not count towards GFA – in short, the GFA is increasing, but the deck will continue to exist whether the roof is there or not. In any case, the increase in GFA is only 0.03.iii.	There is significant support for this project from abutters and neighbors, who do not object to this proposal.","i.	The roofdeck already exists; the Owner is seeking relief to make the deck more usable, integrate the existing roofdeck more into the architectural character of the house, make the rear entry more safe during the winter months, and to prevent accelerated deterioration/protect the deck from weather.ii.

In any case, the increase in GFA is only 0.03.","a.	The roofdeck as it exists, on the second floor, is particularly exposed to the weather; this is a function of the construction and orientation of the roofdeck on this house, not a function of zoning.  Covered porches are more common among other homes of similar design than exposed roofdecks.  b.	Currently, the shape of the roofdeck, which is generally flat, is not necessarily in the character of this home or many of the homes in the area; adding the gable roof will help the integrate the roofdeck more completely into the house itself. Moreover, the existing interior enclosure was clearly an afterthought, with little consideration for design or aesthetics",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,11/03/2017

The structure was modified by construction of a 18.5 feet wide, third-story dormer pursuant to a Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal variance granted in November 1994.  As a result of an unusual feature - a 6.5 feet wide unroofed porch section in the middle of the dormer, the Epsteins have experienced significant issues with water infiltration that has damaged and continues to cause deterioration of the underlying structure and the shingles on that side of the house.  The Petitioners seek to renovate the dormer, extending the roof and exterior wall to enclose what is now the small porch area, incorporating it into the interior living area on the third floor of the Property.  Since this modest renovation will result in an increase in the gross Floor Area (which already exceeds the Ordinance requirements) and a modification to a dormer built pursuant to a variance, the Petitioners require and hereby request a further variance from this Board in order to be allowed to make this modest but important improvement to their home.   The cost of rebuilding the porch in its current configuration would be substantial; and it would be difficult to prevent recurrence of the existing problems.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would pose a substantial hardship for the Epsteins and future owners of the Property who would bear the ongoing extra costs and burdens associated with accumulating water, snow and ice, repairing wood rot, exterior siding, repainting, and other problems associated with the existing unroofed porch.","This minimal relief may be grated without detriment to the public good.  The renovation involves a minor modification to a dormer constructed after allowance of a variance granted by this Board. The porch area to be enclosed is located in an inconspicuous location, at the far rear of the side wall on the third story of the building, largely unseen by others in the neighborhood.  The house that abuts on this side of the building has no windows at the third story level.  The proposed new section of wall along the dormer will contain two windows, providing more privacy than the existing sliding doors and open balusters of the existing porch.  Therefore, the proposed renovation will not interfere with the abutting neighbors' use and enjoyment of their property, will not impact light and air to abutters or create other negative impacts.","The relief requested involves enclosing of a small, third-story porch area within an existing dormer structure, and thereby remedying a design/structural defect that is causing damage to the structure.  The variance is minimal and of the sort that comports with the purpose and intent of the Ordinance to allow for improvements to, and preservation of, the existing housing in the City of Cambridge.",The hardship is owing to the unique shape of the dormer structure and configuration of the porch which is carved into the third-story dormer.  Water pools in the inside corners of the porch and infiltrates behind the gutter and shingles at the exterior wall.

Located along the Smith Campus Center’s interior arcade, swissbäkers will offer an array of healthy, and affordable dining options for breakfast and all day. Prepared in the Swiss culinary tradition, specialties include fresh breads and sandwiches such as the signature pretzel baguette, homemade soups, salads, as well as traditional Swiss baked goods including coconut macaroons and Leckerli. This food venue will be located in the Smith Campus Center which will offer abundant indoor and outdoor seating that is available to the public, including the patrons of swissbäkers.","Traffic generated and patterns of access or egress will not cause a congestion hazard.  Harvard University undertook a voluntary traffic study for the overall Smith Campus Center renovation, which assumed multiple food venues in the building as well as the other proposed uses. This study validated that the project will have no adverse traffic impacts and it was reviewed with the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.The proposed use, swissbäkers, will not create a detriment to the public in terms of traffic impacts as it will serve the same population - Harvard affiliates, Harvard Square and Cambridge residents, workers, and visitors - that have long been served by food establishments in this building which is in a location that is highly pedestrian oriented and transit accessible. This will result in no increase in traffic. The building is located in the heart of Harvard Square and directly adjacent to the MBTA subway and bus station, a Hubway station and the site will be equipped with ample bike parking.  Swissbäkers will be located in the building’s interior along the pedestrian arcade of the Smith Campus Center and will have no direct frontage along the building perimeter. The customers are expected to be walk-ins from the Smith Campus Center and other neighboring buildings as well as those visiting Harvard Square. Loading for swissbäkers will take place at adjacent on-street loading zones on Mt. Auburn Street and Dunster Street, consistent with how the building has been serviced in the past.There will be no change in established neighborhood character as the Petitioner’s proposed use is consistent with pre-existing fast food uses and previous fast food uses in the Smith Campus Center/former Holyoke Center.","The continued operation of or development of adjacent uses as permitted in the CZO will not be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use. The proposed food establishment, swissbäkers, is highly compatible with the existing commercial uses in close proximity and consistent with food establishments that have operated in this building for more than three decades.  With this array of Swiss food offerings, the addition of swissbäkers to the Smith Campus Center will expand the dining choices available within Harvard Square and Cambridge.","There will be no nuisances nor hazards created as there will be centralized building trash and recycling receptacles and removal. These receptacles will be provided in multiple locations throughout the first floor and other areas of the building, and will be convenient to the swissbäkers space. Swissbäkers will only use cardboard cups and plates, and utensils will be recyclable plastic.  Swissbäkers will be located in a building that is being transformed to engage the vibrancy of Harvard Square and meet the needs of Harvard affiliates, visitors, and the Cambridge community in a way that will be of tremendous public benefit.  Overall the building will have improved and expanded seating areas, food venues, and visitor services that are welcoming to all. Forbes Plaza along Massachusetts Avenue is being redesigned to include comfortable seating, chess tables, and new plantings that are inviting and allow for flexible outdoor usage for performances. The new transparent Welcome Area pavilion includes seating areas on the first and second floors with views of Harvard Square and Forbes Plaza for full-year enjoyment. The redesigned Mount Auburn Plaza calls for a lush grove of trees to create a more contemplative plaza with seating, chess tables, and more legible and improved site circulation.  Dunster Street will offer outdoor dining, with a second floor roof garden overlooking the street for a unique Harvard Square experience that can be enjoyed by the public.  The Holyoke Street Pavilion will house a food venue and event space, which will create an active street front. Base building services and amenities will be enhanced including information and ticketing on events and activities at Harvard University, and bike parking. The number of public restrooms will increase and will be relocated to a more convenient location. The sustainable design approach includes green roofs and green walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden within the arcade, and healthy building materials. All visitors to the building, including the customers of swissbäkers, will enjoy these amenities.","The establishment of swissbäkers to be located at the Smith Campus Center will not create any detriment to Harvard Square. The proposal calls for a continuation of the building’s commercial food uses. It will continue to serve the Harvard University population, visitors, and the Cambridge community as it has for decades during the same general time frame from early morning to late at night. The proposed project calls for no adverse impacts in terms of traffic. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested special permit is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center to provide a public benefit to Harvard Square.",Allston,MA,11/03/2017

The proposed signage seeks to appropriately identify the school and its key public spaces, clarify wayfinding for students, faculty, staff and visitors to the GSD, and establish a consistent signage design aesthetic. The largest of the three proposed signs will be located on the southern façade, naming the school which is headquartered in Gund Hall and its primary gallery space. The other two proposed signs are located at the entrances along Quincy Street and Cambridge Street. Except for one existing banner that announces the GSD event schedule, the building currently has no exterior signage visible from the public way and does not provide any visual identification for the school, the building, or its primary spaces.Because Gund Hall is located in a Residence C-3 zoning district, signage for non-residential uses is limited to two (2) non-banner signs per building and a total signage area of 30 sq. ft. per building using only natural or external illumination. To adequately serve the identification and wayfinding needs of this educational campus, a variance is required to permit the number of proposed signs, the area of such signage, and the requested illumination. This proposal would call for three (3) non-banner signs on the building and a total signage area of 63 sq. ft, with two signs employing external illumination on one and internal illumination on two.Other signage at the building which is not visible from a public way, necessary for public safety and convenience, or meeting the criteria for special sign provisions per CZO 7.16.23 have been certified by the Cambridge Community Development Department as exempt from zoning restrictions.A.	A literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner or appellant for the following reasons:A literal enforcement of the provisions of CZO 7.16 would permit a maximum of two (2) signs and a total of 30 sq. ft. of signage for Gund Hall, despite it having approximately 450 ft. of street frontage along two prominent facades and multiple main entrances that are significantly recessed away from the property line. This limitation would prevent Harvard from adequately identifying the school and the major public space in the building frequented by visitors at all key entrances to the building. Such enforcement would create a hardship by making wayfinding more difficult for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to the campus including those attending the many public events hosted by GSD.","The requested variances are necessary to improve wayfinding for the GSD’s multiple users which includes large numbers of the public who visit the campus on a regular basis for educational programs. Therefore, the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public good, but rather will provide a public benefit by improving wayfinding and the visual character of the campus.","The requested variance will allow the placement of adequate signage to better identify campus entrances and to guide visitors to this specific building and school and the programs it accommodates. This is consistent with the CZO’s assertion that the public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available. The requested relief for the number of signs allowed, the signage area, and illumination will allow adequate identification and wayfinding signage at multiple building entry points. The requested relief is unique to the characteristics of an educational campus with large scale buildings and multiple access points, therefore granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the purpose of the Ordinance.","Gund Hall is a large, monolithic concrete structure with approximately 450 feet of street frontage. Other than an existing banner, this prominent building reads as having no exterior signage. Its two main entrances facing the street are recessed under porticos at a distance from the street (56’ west portico, 24’ south portico), not on the front plane, in shadowed spaces without sunlight and not legible for the passerby. Its primary facades are expansive (south elevation facing Cambridge Street has ~10,000 sq. ft. of façade area, west elevation facing Quincy Street has ~16,000 sq. ft. of façade area) and the proposed signage will be visually understated and modest against this large canvas.  These conditions relating to the size and shape of the building make wayfinding unclear and difficult for many visitors to the campus. Additionally, the GSD sponsors many lectures, exhibitions, presentations, discussions and special events in Gund Hall relating to architecture, urban planning, and related disciplines.  These events, many of which are open to the public, attract a significant number of visitors to the building. The Druker Design Gallery is the building’s most prominent gallery space that exhibits the work of GSD students as well as that of nationally and internationally prominent designers, and is open to the public.The physical and use characteristics of this university building (multiple entrances, massing that places entrances far from the public street in recessed spaces, and uses with high public visitation), requires sufficient signage to adequately identify the building and its key spaces. The need for greater flexibility in the signage permitted for non-residential uses in the Residence C-3 zoning district is unique to the function of an educational campus, and is not typical of other uses in the Residence C-3 zoning district.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,Cambridge,MA,11/13/2017

They live on the second and third floors of the house and they rent the first floor. Proximity of their house and neighborhood to their places of work allows them to walk and bike instead of using their car. Their unit has two bedrooms and one bathroom below the roof rafters. The toddler's bedroom measures 9'-4"" wide x 4' long x 7' high. The bathroom wall, against which are installed the plumbing fixtures, is about 4'-6"" high. The Petitioners would like to maintain the house as a two-family, a housing type that is becoming more and more rare in Cambridge as two-families are being transformed into condominiums or into single-family homes. They would like to maintain it for the same reasons that Cambridge desires two-families: the income from the second unit makes it possible for a typical family to purchase a home here and live in it. But their third floor, where the family sleeps, is extremely cramped, and essentially consists of one legal ""room"" since the State Building Code is explicit about minimum room sizes and their child's bedroom does not comply with those dimensional minimums. The Petitioners are a young family who want to stay in a City that commands very high, and in many cases unaffordable, real estate prices. The proposed bedroom addition at the top of the flat-roofed two-story rear portion of the building (from 1986) is a conservative request for an additional 228SF of living space (231SF of floor area) to create a legal bedroom and an additional bathroom, while preserving valuable CambridgePort open land below.","The proposed third floor bedroom addition casts minimal shadow on the abutting properties, and also is only minimally visible from Kinnaird Street. Taking advantage of the top of the rear ell is an urban strategy that preserves ground and garden and densifies upward instead of sprawling outward. And contrary to being detrimental to the public good, preservation of two-family buildings and creating housing units that can accomodate the life of a normal family actually benefits the public. No population density is increased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal.","The proposal not only does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property, it contributes to maintaining useable family housing units in a City that is hungry for them.","As is true of many Cambridge properties, the lot size of 52 Kinnaird Street is less than the minimum lot area for its zoning district. There is no driveway on the lot, and no available space to expand the footprint of the building. Nor would it be desireable to do so since land is at a premium in the neighborhood and the yard is a cherished green space for the Petitioners. Because the house is organized as a two-family with the rental unit on the first floor, and because basements in CambridgePort are constructed on a very high water table and are thus consistently very wet, expansion to the lower level of the house is not possible without expanding the structure's footprint. Uniquely and fortuitously, the rear portion of the building's second story was constructed with a flat roof, which would allow the Petitioners to solve the critical problem of the inadequately sized and cramped bedroom with a third floor addition there.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,12/13/2017

Located along the Smith Campus Center’s interior arcade, PAVEMENT will offer coffee-bar service (coffee and espresso drinks) bagels, breakfast pastries, pre-made sandwiches and salads. This food venue will be located in the Smith Campus Center which will offer abundant indoor and outdoor seating that is available to the public, including the patrons of Pavement Coffeehouse.","Traffic generated and patterns of access or egress will not cause a congestion hazard.  Harvard University undertook a voluntary traffic study for the overall Smith Campus Center renovation, which assumed multiple food venues in the building as well as the other proposed uses. This study validated that the project will have no adverse traffic impacts and it was reviewed with the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.The proposed use, Pavement Coffeehouse, will not create a detriment to the public in terms of traffic impacts as it will serve the same population - Harvard affiliates, Harvard Square and Cambridge residents, workers, and visitors - that have long been served by food establishments in this building which is in a location that is highly pedestrian oriented and transit accessible. This will result in no increase in traffic. The building is located in the heart of Harvard Square and directly adjacent to the MBTA subway and bus station, a Hubway station and the site will be equipped with ample bike parking.  Pavement will be located in the building’s interior along the pedestrian arcade of the Smith Campus Center and will have no direct frontage along the building perimeter. The customers are expected to be walk-ins from the Smith Campus Center and other neighboring buildings as well as those visiting Harvard Square. Loading for Pavement will take place at adjacent on-street loading zones on Mt. Auburn Street and Dunster Street, consistent with how the building has been serviced in the past.There will be no change in established neighborhood character as the Petitioner’s proposed use is consistent with pre-existing fast food uses and previous fast food uses in the Smith Campus Center/former Holyoke Center.","The continued operation of or development of adjacent uses as permitted in the CZO will not be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use. The proposed food establishment, Pavement, is highly compatible with the existing commercial uses in close proximity and consistent with food establishments that have operated in this building for more than three decades.  With this array of food offerings, the addition of Pavement to the Smith Campus Center will expand the dining choices available within Harvard Square and Cambridge.","There will be no nuisances nor hazards created as there will be centralized building trash and recycling receptacles and removal. These receptacles will be provided in multiple locations throughout the first floor and other areas of the building, and will be convenient to the petitioner’s space. Pavement will only use cardboard cups and plates, and utensils will be recyclable plastic.  Pavement will be located in a building that is being transformed to engage the vibrancy of Harvard Square and meet the needs of Harvard affiliates, visitors, and the Cambridge community in a way that will be of tremendous public benefit.  Overall the building will have improved and expanded seating areas, food venues, and visitor services that are welcoming to all. Forbes Plaza along Massachusetts Avenue is being redesigned to include comfortable seating, chess tables, and new plantings that are inviting and allow for flexible outdoor usage for performances. The new transparent Welcome Area pavilion includes seating areas on the first and second floors with views of Harvard Square and Forbes Plaza for full-year enjoyment. The redesigned Mount Auburn Plaza calls for a lush grove of trees to create a more contemplative plaza with seating, chess tables, and more legible and improved site circulation.  Dunster Street will offer outdoor dining, with a second floor roof garden overlooking the street for a unique Harvard Square experience that can be enjoyed by the public.  The Holyoke Street Pavilion will house a food venue and event space, which will create an active street front. Base building services and amenities will be enhanced including information and ticketing on events and activities at Harvard University, and bike parking. The number of public restrooms will increase and will be relocated to a more convenient location. The sustainable design approach includes green roofs and green walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden within the arcade, and healthy building materials. All visitors to the building, including the customers of Pavement, will enjoy these amenities.","The establishment of Pavement to be located at the Smith Campus Center will not create any detriment to Harvard Square. The proposal calls for a continuation of the building’s commercial food uses. It will continue to serve the Harvard University population, visitors, and the Cambridge community as it has for decades during the same general time frame from early morning to late at night. The proposed project calls for no adverse impacts in terms of traffic. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested special permit is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center to provide a public benefit to Harvard Square.",Boston,MA,11/30/2017

The facing facade of adjacent house, which is separated from the property by a driveway, is approximately 18 feet away.  The proposed dormer will be on the south facade and will minimally increase the shadows cast.","While the proposed addition will increase the mass of the building, the renovated house will not exceed the massing of many of the surrounding buildings.

A screened porch, once a staple of American houses, allows enjoyment of the outdoors while imposing minimally on the land.","The granting of the requested relief for a reasonably sized screened porch would not work towards the detriment of the citizens of Cambridge nor the neighborhood because the relif sought is owing only to the fact that 72 Raymond Street is a corner lot.

It is the fact that as a corner lot they are subject to two frontyard setbacks that makes their house non-conforming and subject to requiring zoning relief for a modest structure.

The owner and his family occupy this home and have young children. The addition of the play room would allow them to better enjoy their home and lives in the city of Cambridge. This proposed play room would be built over an existing single story portion of the home. This single story portion contains the entrance to the basement level apartment and also the boiler room for the entire home. In order to build above this portion of the home, we need to relocate the entrance to the basement. The home is already non-conforming for it's rear yard and side yard (north side yard) setbacks. Construction of the addition would conform to the existing side and rear yard setbacks. We are asking relief from the side and rear yard setback in order to build the addition to the existing setback. We are additionally asking for relief from the front yard setback. It is non-conforming, however, no construction is proposed at the front of the home. Literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in a hardship to the owner as they would receive less enjoyment from their home. The owner could construct an addition and conform to the ordinance, but there would be additional hardship as this conforming addition would be more costly, block access to the rear yard, not be as attractive and would encroach on the parking area. Locating the play room addition, and basement access, to conform with required setbacks would encroach on the parking area and on the access to the first floor unit.Please note: the board has already granted a variance for this project, but we are returning because we have eliminated the rear yard addition (entry to basement). This entry has been relocated to the side and is now an open stair rather than an enclosed stair.","The proposed project - additions to an existing 2 family home - can be granted without detriment to the public good because: 1) the project does not change the use of the building or property 2) the project does not change the intensity of the use 3) the proposed project will improve the look of the existing building 3) the proposed project will not alter traffic patterns, emit noxious odors or sounds, cause a hazard to the population.","We are requesting relief from the side yard setback. The existing setback is 2.1 feet, and we would not be changing the side yard setback as part of this project. We are asking for relief from the rear yard setback. The existing setback is 14.3 feet and no change is proposed. The proposed addition would improve the look of the home, changing a single story cement block addition into an addition that looks and feels more like the home it's attached to. The granting of relief would allow safe egress from the basement level apartment and would allow the play room addition to be constructed above the existing single story portion of the home. The home has an existing 4' front yard setback, which will not be changed as part of this project. We are requesting relief from the front yard setback, if required by the board for this project. Relief for this project can be grated without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because 1) the requested relief is small and is the result of the existing condition of the property 2) the proposed addition are a type of space that is enjoyed by many properties in the city and in the zone 3) the request for front yard setback is only recognizing an existing condition that will not be changed as part of this project. 4) the request for side yard setback is an existing condition that will not be changed as part of this project, it is only required in order to build to the same setback 5) the rear yard setback is existing and no change is proposed to this setback.","Hardship is owning to the existing shape of the structure on the lot. If the home was located with conforming setbacks, the addition would be permitted outright. Due to the pre-existing non-conforming nature of the side and rear setbacks, the most logical location of the addition is above the existing single story portion of the home.

Located along the Smith Campus Center’s interior arcade, Whole Heart Provisions will offer an assortment of 100% plant based, healthy, and delicious dishes comprised of veggie and grain bowls, as well as snacks such as seared avocados and street corn, for lunch and dinner. This food venue will be located in the Smith Campus Center which will offer abundant indoor and outdoor seating that is available to the public, including the patrons of Whole Heart Provisions.","Traffic generated and patterns of access or egress will not cause a congestion hazard.  Harvard University undertook a voluntary traffic study for the overall Smith Campus Center renovation, which assumed multiple food venues in the building as well as the other proposed uses. This study validated that the project will have no adverse traffic impacts and it was reviewed with the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.The proposed use, Whole Heart Provisions, will not create a detriment to the public in terms of traffic impacts as it will serve the same population - Harvard affiliates, Harvard Square and Cambridge residents, workers, and visitors - that have long been served by food establishments in this building which is in a location that is highly pedestrian oriented and transit accessible. This will result in no increase in traffic. The building is located in the heart of Harvard Square and directly adjacent to the MBTA subway and bus station, a Hubway station and the site will be equipped with ample bike parking.  Whole Heart Provisions will be located in the building’s interior along the pedestrian arcade of the Smith Campus Center and will have no direct frontage along the building perimeter. The customers are expected to be walk-ins from the Smith Campus Center and other neighboring buildings as well as those visiting Harvard Square. Loading for Whole Heart Provisions will take place at adjacent on-street loading zones on Mt. Auburn Street and Dunster Street, consistent with how the building has been serviced in the past.There will be no change in established neighborhood character as the Petitioner’s proposed use is consistent with pre-existing fast food uses and previous fast food uses in the Smith Campus Center/former Holyoke Center.","The continued operation of or development of adjacent uses as permitted in the CZO will not be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use. The proposed food establishment, Whole Heart Provisions, is highly compatible with the existing commercial uses in close proximity and consistent with food establishments that have operated in this building for more than three decades.  With this array of food offerings, the addition of Whole Heart Provisions to the Smith Campus Center will expand the dining choices available within Harvard Square and Cambridge.","There will be no nuisances nor hazards created as there will be centralized building trash and recycling receptacles and removal. These receptacles will be provided in multiple locations throughout the first floor and other areas of the building, and will be convenient to the petitioner’s space. Whole Heart Provisions will only use cardboard cups and plates, and utensils will be recyclable plastic.  Whole Heart Provisions will be located in a building that is being transformed to engage the vibrancy of Harvard Square and meet the needs of Harvard affiliates, visitors, and the Cambridge community in a way that will be of tremendous public benefit.  Overall the building will have improved and expanded seating areas, food venues, and visitor services that are welcoming to all. Forbes Plaza along Massachusetts Avenue is being redesigned to include comfortable seating, chess tables, and new plantings that are inviting and allow for flexible outdoor usage for performances. The new transparent Welcome Area pavilion includes seating areas on the first and second floors with views of Harvard Square and Forbes Plaza for full-year enjoyment. The redesigned Mount Auburn Plaza calls for a lush grove of trees to create a more contemplative plaza with seating, chess tables, and more legible and improved site circulation.  Dunster Street will offer outdoor dining, with a second floor roof garden overlooking the street for a unique Harvard Square experience that can be enjoyed by the public.  The Holyoke Street Pavilion will house a food venue and event space, which will create an active street front. Base building services and amenities will be enhanced including information and ticketing on events and activities at Harvard University, and bike parking. The number of public restrooms will increase and will be relocated to a more convenient location. The sustainable design approach includes green roofs and green walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden within the arcade, and healthy building materials. All visitors to the building, including the customers of Whole Heart Provisions, will enjoy these amenities.","The establishment of Whole Heart Provisions to be located at the Smith Campus Center will not create any detriment to Harvard Square. The proposal calls for a continuation of the building’s commercial food uses. It will continue to serve the Harvard University population, visitors, and the Cambridge community as it has for decades during the same general time frame from early morning to late at night. The proposed project calls for no adverse impacts in terms of traffic. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested special permit is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the Richard A. and Susan F.

Soils at 55 Regent Street and in the adjacent properties contain large amounts of peat and high seasonal watertable levels.   These conditions have dramatically increased the cost of foundation construction on the site.

It was one of three multi-family houses on a small street currently zoned A-2.  As we started to plan for a family, we petitioned for and were granted a variance for the BZA in 1986 to add a shed dormer to the attic to make it a third bedroom.  This variance expired as our family plans were unexpectedly delayed.  By 1994, with a 3 yr old son and a hoping for a second child, we converted the house to a 1-family residence.  This alteration did not require a special permit or variance.Twenty+ years later, we would very much like to stay in our home (and with the neighbors we've known for up to a third of a century!) for as long as our health allows.  Financially, however, we anticipate this becoming a hardship and a burden on our retirement savings.  We are also worried that maintenance will also become burdensome, physically and financially, unless we cut back on our living space.So, we ask the BZA to allow us to convert our home back to its original 2-family status.  To have a unit rentable to a young family (we are one block from the highly desirable Graham and Parks School), and space taht woudl allow us to have live-in care if needed, we ask for a small increase in the living area (63 sq ft more to the existing 4374 sq ft), that will alllow for two well-configured units.  The configuration is similar to the orginal:  unit 1 is the first floor plus the southeast corner of the 2nd floor; unit 2 is the bulk of the 2nd floor plus the attic floor with new shed dormers to the east and west (and removal of the south dormer).","We have consulted with the east and west abutters, and they have all approved of our plan. We will consult with the rear abutters (a condo association) sufficiently prior to our hearing to make any changes necessary to get their approval.  More generally, the visual impact from the street side is minimal due to the extensive mature foundation plantings.  This will also be reviewed by the Avon Hill Conservation Commission.","Rather than derogating from the intent of the Ordinance, we believe this plan is very much in keeping with the spirit of the recent changes to support the addition of accessory apartments to assist with the severe housing shortage in Cambridge.  While too large to be an accessory apartment (we looked into this but were hindered by egress, financial, and other concerns), we believe restoring our house to its original 2-family use is in keeping with goals of the City.","Like many older Cambridge residences, our home was non-conforming along numerous dimensions when we bought it in 1984.  These included total gross floor area, lot area, FAR, lot area per unit, lot width, and setbacks on two sides. We believe the only thing that has changed in all of these areas since 1984 is that sometime between our 1986 variance and today, our side of Bate St was rezoned from B to A-2 to be like the rest of the street. So, the hardship that leads us to need a variance is due to the original circumstances of the original building and lot being non-conforming, plus the subsequent rezoning.","Our east (left) side setback is only 5ft, so that construction or exterior changes on the east side requires a Special Permit.  The proposed construction is to add a new door to the facade for the 2nd floor unit, a bicycle shed, and new windows on the east wall for additonal light.  The door/windows will be in a style to match the current building.  Second, the rear setback is 20 ft vs. the required 25ft.  On this side, we request to add two new windows, in exactly the same style as the existing, and a spiral staircase down from the rear 2nd floor porch to ground level as the 2nd means of egress from the 2nd floor unit. This staircase will be largely hidden from all neighbors by large trees and a wall on the west side.","The area between our house and the house to east is rarely used (we call it ""Siberia"").   There is no easy access for our house, and it is used as a rear and basement entrance to our neighbor's house.  There will be no impact on the character of the building, or the neighborhood in terms of traffic.The rear staircase empties into our rear fenced-in yard, so will have no impact on neighbors.","The existing uses for the south side would continue as they have been without change.  On the east side, the close neighbor does not believe there will be any impact on her family.",The entrance to the new 2nd floor unit would be protected from the street by the large existing plantings.,The changes requested related to the Special Permit will be quite discrete from the street view.,Cambridge,MA,03/07/2018

This modest increase in area will allow for the house to be renovated for family living, with appropriate kitchen space and a safe access to the rear door. The conversion of the 245 SF garage to living space represents a .0570 increase in FAR, but does not increase the amount of building on the property. The Usable Open Space and the Permeable Open Space will both be increased. The proposed work will conform to all other aspects of the Ordinance. The property will remain a single-family residence. The pedestrian traffic and patterns of access and egress will be essentially unchanged.

Most of the wood structure was destroyed, and was determined by the insurance company to be removed.  Due to issues of water and mold, the owner has chosen to remove the existing foundation and rebuild the entire structure in its exact location and with the same internal GFA.The window configuration on the entire house will change.  Because the long, left side of the house (north) is within the required setback, these changes will require a Special Permit.  And the Owner wishes to create a new stair configuration on the rear of the house, and would prefer a covered access for these stairs, as this will effectively be the main entry because of its proximity to the garage.  Building a covered entry creates approximately 34SF additional GFA, which will require a Variance.  There is currently a building permit application in place for the reconstruction of the previously existing structure, which encloses pre-existing GFA covered porches.  This BZA application assumes that this building permit application will be granted, and the new configuration, with a full height 3rd floor (built only in the previous GFA space) will be granted.The Appellant and Owner of 54 Reservoir Street wishes to obtain one Special Permit, as follows:1.	Special permit:  Modification of window openings within a required setback. •	Due to the total fire damage of the existing structure, the rebuilding of the structure with a modified internal layout is appropriate. This requires a Special Permit for the reorganization of the openings on the side of the structure that is non-conforming to the required setback (left side).

Basement height increasei.	The use occupying the basement is within the character of the neighborhood and district, being a multifamily house. The basement height increase will merely allow the family to fully occupy their house in a more comfortable, and safe, manner.b.	Additioni.	The proposed addition meets all dimensional requirements of Table 5-1, as shown in the drawings. ii.	8.22.2[c] indicates that the BZA may grant a special permit for the alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure provided that: 1.	It is not an alteration or enlargement of a non-conforming use [the proposed is an enlargement and alteration, but of a conforming use.]2.	The enlargement or alteration is not in further violation of the dimensional requirements of Article 5 [it is not; see drawings for full analysis and explanation]3.	The enlargement or alteration is not in further violation of the off street parking and loading requirements of Article 6 [it is not; see drawings for full analysis and explanation]4.	The enlargement or alteration may not increase in area or volume by more than 25% since it first began to be non-conforming [it does not; see drawings for full analysis and explanation]iii.	The proposed addition is in the character of the neighborhood and district, choosing to use the additional FAR allowed by Special Permit for a family kitchen addition, rather than a change of use, additional unit, or other density-increasing action. The owner has recently renovated the rear yards of both 25/29/31 Fairmont, some of which was an eyesore to the neighbors, and this addition respects that renovation and the owner’s long-term plans of staying in the neighborhood. The owner’s desire is to create a home more conducive to family life with 3 kids, and to remain in the neighborhood [all three kids are in CPS] and continue to positively contribute to the improvement of the neighborhood.","a.	Basement height increasei.	Since the height increase only adds additional height area to the existing living space, but does not increase the number of units, it will not add additional occupants to the house. Without additional occupants or an additional unit, there will not be a need for additional parking. ii.	Existing patterns of egress from the basement will be modified by the proposed addition, but only in that the exit will be moved about 10’ further to the rear of the lot. The exit from the basement will be the same exit door as the new at-grade entrance of the house.","a.	Basement height increasei.	The proposed height increase only affects existing living space, and does not change the use or number of units or occupants. Like this property, all adjacent uses are also multifamily residential, and are not affected by the owner of this property merely having more headroom in the basement space. b.	Additioni.	The proposed addition does not change the use or the number of units or occupants, keeping in line with surrounding multifamily residential units. ii.	The addition’s layout, as proposed, attempts to minimize impact on neighboring residents, by keeping the addition attached to the existing buildings. The addition could have been a separate structure in the rear yard, which would have blocked views and added to the density of built space in the rear yards. Instead, this proposal tucks the addition efficiently up to the existing house, keeping it virtually invisible to side neighbors, and preserving open views/air for all surrounding neighbors. iii.	The addition complies with all setbacks and area/height limitations, per Section 5-1 of the Zoning Ordinance, which is ensures that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected by the location and volume of the addition.","a.	Basement height increasei.	The proposed height increase only affects existing living space, and does not change the use or number of units or occupants, meaning no additional nuisances would be created by additional tenants or density in the area.ii.	For the occupant of the space, the increased basement ceiling height allows a code-compliant living space, which is much more preferable for the Owner, as the parent of three small children. b.	Additioni.	The proposed addition does not change the use or the number of units or occupants.  ii.	Building the addition will likely necessitate other building code updates, which will only serve to make the whole building safer for occupants as well as neighboring buildings.","a.	Basement height increasei.	The proposed height increase is a straightforward use of the GFA exception to allow a family greater and safer use of their existing basement, without adding occupants or parking, and is therefore in the character and spirit of the exception.b.	Additioni.	The proposed addition sensitively and carefully adds to the existing house – within all required setbacks and other dimensional provisions of the Zoning Ordinance – to allow a family greater use of their house by adding a kitchen and mudroom. Without changing use, adding occupants, blocking views, increasing the need for parking, the addition is within the spirit and character of the neighborhood. ii.	Per 8.22.2, the addition fully complies with allowable enlargements to non-conforming structures. iii.	Architecturally, the proposed addition uses the same size windows as on the existing building, and will replace the siding on the entire rear volume of the house [29/31 Farimont] to ensure the addition is neatly and thoughtfully integrated into the existing house. Inspired by the proportions and alignments present in the immediately adjacent properties, the addition is sensitive to the neighborhood context, both materially and compositionally.iv.	The owner has recently renovated the rear yards of both 25/29/31 Fairmont, some of which was an eyesore to the neighbors, and this addition respects that renovation and the owner’s long term plans of staying in the neighborhood. The owner’s desire is to create a home more conducive to family life with 3 kids, and to remain in  the neighborhood [all three kids are in CPS] and continue to positively contribute to the improvement of the neighborhood.",Cambridge,MA,04/25/2018

Both of us work in Cambridge and our children attend Cambridge Public Schools.  After almost 3 years on Muller Avenue, we feel firmly rooted in the North Cambridge community and request the variance to enable renovating our home and construct a third floor expansion into our existing full height unfinished/unused attic space configured to best serve our family’s needs.We are requesting a variance to add two opposing 15-foot shed dormers to the third floor for two reasons:   First is that a dormer addition on one side will allow for reconstruction of the existing 2nd to 3rd floor attic staircase to be rebuilt to stack above the existing lower stair, in such a way as to meet current egress code requirements for rise and tread and clear headroom for third floor access.  Secondly, we would greatly prefer (for various family and safety reasons)  that our two young children have bedrooms located on the same floor and close by their parents. Including a second matching dormer opposite the stair on the 3rd floor would allow for contiguous sleeping spaces on 3rd floor  for our whole family.","To ameliorate our request for overall zoning relief for adding FAR on the third floor, we are proposing to simultaneously cut back elsewhere the area/ bulk of the building by demolishing  the existing 2 story covered rear porches, and rebuild there instead a new smaller 1 story porch with upper open deck, connected to  grade with an outside egress stair .  This would allow our family and young children to more readily access and enjoy our property's private outdoor open play area in the rear back yard, and allow better visual adult supervision and connection of that space to the upstairs unit.","The proposed project with porch rebuild represents a modest net added  “ask” of 82 SF of additional FAR, without increase to footprint or reduction to open or landscaped space.Our property will continue to function as a two-family home with no changes in the 4-person occupancy of #15 Muller Ave (unit undergoing renovation) and no significant changes,/modest improvement) to  #17 Muller Ave rental unit downstairs.Addition of 15’ dormers is not inconsistent with the dormer guidelines, or with the neighboring homes, many of which were originally built all on the same template. Both our next door neighbors (9-11 Muller and 19-21 Muller) have shed dormers. 9-11 has three dormers extending the length of the roofline, while 19-21 has one dormer substantially longer than 15 feet (see pictures within variance submittal).","The low clearances and configuration of the existing attic access stair, and nonconforming lot/right side setback present a hardship for zoning compliance.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,03/15/2018

The HGSE campus consists of only six buildings centered on Appian Way.  These buildings cannot house the School's entire academic program, requiring many programs to be dispersed in leased space throughout Harvard Square.  Longfellow Hall serves as the HGSE's academic and administrative hub, containing classrooms, meeting spaces, and faculty and administrative offices. The renovation and expansion of Longfellow Hall is a key component of the HGSE's long term vision to develop a more cohesive physical campus on Appian Way. There is very limited ability to add additional space to Longfellow Hall in a manner that meets the School's programmatic needs due to existing topography and other site constraints, and the historic nature of the structure itself and its setting in historic Radcliffe Yard.  The proposed project achieves this by reprogramming existing space within the building and introducing a limited amount of new construction that is in keeping with the building's historic architecture. The project's new construction which requires zoning relief is limited to the following elements:- At the 4th floor, new construction within the required front yard setback consists of three new dormer windows at the Appian Way elevation, and a small portion of an existing light well that is being enclosed.  - At the new penthouse level, a portion of this addition is within the required front yard setback.  The penthouse is being added at the ridge point of the building's existing hipped roof, and is located at the center of the building block to minimize its overall visual impact to the historic building, the Appian Way streetscape and to Radcliffe Yard. When Longfellow Hall was constructed in 1929, the building met the CZO set back requirements of 25' to Appian Way.  The building was made non-conforming for its front yard set back in 1943, when changes to the CZO set back requirements were adopted. Because the current set back requirement is a function of building height and length, the added height of the new addition requires a front yard set back of 56'-6"", meaning that portions of the new construction will be located within the required set back.The building's existing setback to Appian Way will not change, and the construction within the required setback is all located on the upper floors of the building, and well within the existing plane of the Appian Way facade.  The placement of the new 4th floor dormers on the Appian Way side of the building is consistent with the location of the existing historic dormers on the Radcliffe Yard side of the building. The penthouse placement is dictated by the location of existing paired chimneys, the ridge line of the existing roof, relationship to vertical circulation, the structure of the existing 4th floor and the historic building's strong symmetrical massing.The structural design for the 5th floor penthouse has been developed to pick up the loads of the 4th floor roof ridge line structure on the Appian Way side of the building.  The current structural design and alignment of the penthouse floor with the existing roof ridge allows these necessary connections to the existing structure to be made in the most effective way.  Moving the placement of the penthouse in anyway would have a significant structural impact to the building involving major reconstruction. Given these existing constraints, it is not possible to create an addition which meets the set back requirement.   A literal enforcement of the provisions of CZO 5.31 would require an addition that would have signficant structural impacts to the building, and would severely disrupt the building's architectural symmetry, adversely impacting a National Register listed building.","The proposed renovation and expansion of Longfellow Hall will result in public benefits including a significant improvement in building functionality and efficiency, improved access for persons with disabilities, and a sizeable investment in one of the City's historic resources. The proposed project is consistent with the City's institutional growth policies which encourage increased utilization of existing facilities. The project will dramatically improve the accessibility for persons with disabilities including the introduction of new accessible entrances, toilet rooms and assembly spaces. The project will use sustainable construction methods and materials with the goal of achieving LEED Gold certifcation.  Through this project, Harvard is also furthering the preservation of a National Register building, and an integral part of Radcliffe Yard.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place and to be altered and expanded.  The amount of nominal new gross floor area can be easily accomodated within the lot's existing FAR, and the proposed height is well below the 85' maximum in the Residence C-2 zoning district.  The proposed project will comply fully with the current CZO requirements with the exception of proposed additions within the front yard setback.  The increase in the existing front yard set back non-conformity is the result of the increase in building height and its impact on the set back formula, however, the project will result in no physical change to the actual set back of the building to Appian Way. Therefore, the requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will further the preseravation of a legally non-conforming historic structure while significantly improving the efficiency and functionality of its intended use.","Longfellow Hall is situated among several historic Harvard institutional buildings that surround Radcliffe Yard. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building in the Old Cambridge Historic District.  The building's location, surrounding topography, site characteristics, and historic character pose constraints on Harvard's ability to increase the building's program area while respecting the building's architectural character and adequately addressing the School's programmatic needs.Expansion of the building toward Radcliffe Yard would significantly impact the historic integrity of the Yard, and would also need to address a significant change in grade from Appian Way.  To the east, the building is bordered by the Radcliffe Insitute's ""sunken garden"" a significant historic landscape element on the Radcliffe campus that has been recently restored. One of the key character defining elements of the buildings is its overarching symmetry, both in its massing and in architectural details. (The building is closely patterned after Harvard's University Hall which was designed by Charles Bulfinch, and constructed in 1815.)  Additions or expansion at the western side of the building would have an adverse impact on the building's strong symmetrical massing, and require significant structural and mechanical intervention in the original historic building.  The additions as proposed have been reviewed favorably by the Cambridge Historical Commission as an appropriate and well considered expansion to the building. Finally, Longfellow Hall is located in an area comprised almost solely of other Harvard institutional buildings.  Longfellow Hall and its proposed addition are consistent with the size and physical character of these surrounding institutional buildings.  The location of Longfellow Hall amidst an institutional campus, the architectural character of the building itself and the historical signficance of the properties surrounding Radcliffe Yard are circumstances that do not generally affect the Residence C-2 zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,02/27/2014

He was issued a permit for 47 Dudley St Cambridge to renovate an existing single family residential structure. But before he picked it up he was told that it was issued in error. The other permits for the 2 families were issued without any problem.The next day petitioner went to the Cambridge building department and spoke with Building Inspector Peter McLaughlin, Sean O’Grady from Zoning and the Building Commissioner Ranjit Singanayagam. Petitioner informed them that the property was taxed, assessed and listed as a single family residential unit by the City of Cambridge on its website. Petitioner wanted to know what the error/issue was for 47 Dudley St.After speaking with all of the above individuals petitioner was told the existing use for thisproperty is as a private office. He was then issued a building permit to renovate an existingprivate office space.  He was told that even though the City taxes it as and assesses it asa single family residence that he needed to obtain a use variance to convert the space to asingle family residential unit as it is listed on the City of Cambridge Database. Peter McLaughlin also informed the contractor that the variance will need to show the set ofstairs going up to the second floor as the second means of egress. There are 2 existing meansof egress currently in place, the new stairs will just be in a better layout with the renovationstaking place.Brief History of 47 Dudley St Buidings ConditionsEvery time petitioner visited the property before purchase, these were the conditions he observed at the 47 Dudley St building. On every site visit to 47 Dudley St, except one time, there was a gentleman name Myles there, who the realtor said was living there and had been living there in exchange for maintaining and managing the 3 buildings.Inside 47 Dudley St there was a full bathroom with a toilet, shower, vanity. In the living area there as a couch, mini fridge, clothes, space heater and a countertop with what looked like a hot plate. It gave the impression of being a residential unit that was just not maintained very well over the years.Myles moved from 47 Dudley after the closing.This project will not involve any addition to the exterior footprint or structure of any of the buildings. The only change is to the calculated floor area of 47 Dudley due to the capturing of previously uncalculated basement space into living space.","This use will be an asset to the area, providing much needed residential space, in an area that is largely residential.",This unit has been used as residential historically.,This small building has been used de facto as residential and is part of a parcel that is zoned as residential.,,,,,,Cambridge,MA,02/21/2018

In 2014 the property was in a distressed state and Petitioner’s commenced a complete gut renovation of the property intending to do a modest renovation. Due to several unknown defects and conditions of the property Petitioner was required to fully gut and renovate the entire building which added significant unexpected costs. As a result of the extensive renovation (hvac, electrical, plumbing etc) the Petitioner also updated the layout and design of the units consistent with contemporary living standards. During the demolition phase of the renovation work Petitioner determined that the property may have historically contained as many as seven units in the dwelling based on the assessor’s database showing seven (7) units and pre-existing interior layout of the dwelling. Based on the assumption that seven (7) units were either grandfathered and or allowed Petitioner reconfigured the dwellings in the structure to include two basement dwellings units increasing the number of units from five (5) to seven(7). Without relief Petitioner would be required to leave the two newly constructed basement units unoccupied resulting in financial hardship and economic waste.",Desirable relief may be granted without the substantial detriment to the public good because the property can comfortably accommodate the two additional units because there is sufficient parking onsite and will have minimal impact to the adjacent properties and the neighborhood which are similarly larger multifamily dwellings.,The requested relief will not substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance which promotes the most rational use of land throughout the city. Granting the aforementioned relief will allow the newly renovated basement dwelling units to add to Cambridge’s housing stock of renovated rental dwellings units.,The Hardship is owing to the pre-existing non-conforming multifamily dwelling that exceeds the dimensional requirements of the district such that any increase in the number of units would require zoning relief. Further the two basement units are now complete and Petitioner only realized their mistake when Petitioner applied for its Certificate of Occupancy and learned that building department only has registered five (5) pre-existing dwelling units for the property.,,,,,,Cambridge,MA,04/27/2018

Rachel and Lawrence have lived in Cambridge our entire adult lives (20 and 24 years, respectively - Cambridge residential property owners since 2003) and both work in the city. We’ve committed to raising our our growing family (son born 2015) here and decided to purchase a two family in late 2016 in order to combine households with Lawrence’s parents in a mutually beneficial multigenerational housing arrangement (Emma cares for our son while we work and we intend to support them as needed as they age). We love our new neighborhood (current residence purchased in late 2016) and our neighborhood community in the Whittemore triangle. We hope to secure a variance to enable renovating our home by adding dormers to our currently unfinished third floor attic space, ideally configured to support the typical needs of a family over many years. We are requesting a variance to add two opposing 15-foot shed dormers to the third floor attic area for two reasons: First is that a dormer addition on one side will allow for the existing 2nd to 3rd floor attic staircase to be rebuilt with adequate headroom that comply to current egress code requirements. Additionally, a family bathroom can be constructed in the remainder of this dormer to increase the total number of bathrooms in the unit to 2.0 total. The opposing dormer space would be used to accommodate the construction of an additional bedroom on the third floor. The design allows for a total of three bedrooms on the third floor, which would enable us to have our whole family (we hope to have additional children) sleeping contiguously on one floor for safety and convenience. Moreover, this increased total number of rooms in the 29 Seagrave unit overall would allow us to maintain a home office as well as comfortably relocate our parents into our unit should their aging processes require more closely attended care.","The increase in GFA by 203 SF, 0.041 increase in FAR, and 2.67% increase in total volume resulting from the addition of the proposed dormers fits well within the scale of the neighboring houses and within the spirit of the recommended dormer guidelines.","The proposed project represents an increase of additional FAR, due to the increase in roof height and subsequent increase in usable floor space at the requested 15’ dormers, without increase to footprint or reduction in open or landscaped space. Our property will continue to function as a two-family with multiple generations occupying both units of our home for the foreseeable future.Our immediate neighbors at 28 Seagrave has a dormer, as do several other homes on both Seagrave and Whittemore. In addition, we have made an attempt to keep the look and placement of the dormers on our roof aesthetically appealing and consistent with the rest of the structure, particularly relevant considering our property’s prominent/visible location on a corner near the intersection of route 2 and route 16.","The low clearances and configuration of the existing attic access stair present a hardship for zoning compliance. In addition, our property’s location in a FEMA flood zone near the uncertainly developing Fresh Pond/Alewife Commercial District and proximity to Alewife watershed make it particularly prone to increasing flooding risk from climate change. We have some concerns about leveraging our basement floor area for additional living area as has been encouraged recently by Cambridge zoning amendments.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,04/27/2018

The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Front Yard Setback(CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum setback to street)• To permit location of proposed material lift within the required minimum setback.Variance 2: Alteration or Enlargement of a Nonconforming Structure.(CZO 8.22.3, not otherwise permitted by CZO 8.22.1 and 8.22.2)• To permit the alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure not otherwise permitted by issuance of a building permit or special permit.Project DescriptionThe Schlesinger Library (originally Radcliffe College Library) was constructed in 1908, and is one of several late 19th and early 20th c. buildings that comprise Radcliffe Yard. The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study is planning a project at the Schlesinger Library designed to position it as a continued leader in special collections libraries. The project's planned interior renovations will re-imagine existing library spaces to foster interactive access to library collections. The project also includes a comprehensive restoration of the library exterior that will include needed repairs to the building envelope, and window restoration. As part of the project, a small exterior material lift is proposed to facilitate book and other deliveries to the Library. The proposed lift, measuring approximately 4’-5” x 5’-5” is proposed to be located within an existing areaway at the James Street side of the building. The addition of the material lift is the subject of this variance request.The Schlesinger Library was constructed prior to the adoption of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance provisions which established minimum yard and between building setback requirements. The Residence C-2 zoning district establishes a minimum front yard setback by formula of a minimum of 39’ measured from the centerline of street, but not less than 10’ to the street line. It also establishes a between building setback by formula to Agassiz House (the nearest building on the same lot) of 18.5’. The Schlesinger Library is non-conforming for the front yard setback as measured to the centerline of James Street (approximately 32’) and to the street line (approximately 7.5’ to the street line at its nearest point); and the between building setback with Agassiz House (approximately 11’).The proposed enclosed material lift is to be located within an existing areaway on the James Street side of the building. The location of the lift is just outside of the required front yard setback as measured to the centerline of James Street, but will be within the required 10’ minimum setback to the street line. The addition of the exterior material lift will also increase the building’s existing non-conformity for the minimum required setback at this location by approximately 3’.Like many Harvard special collections libraries, the Schlesinger Library stores almost 80% of the archival collection, including books, manuscripts, and other research materials off-site at the Harvard University Depository. The Library’s research function relies on regularly scheduled deliveries to and from the Depository. The existing lack of a dedicated material lift for books and other materials requires that deliveries share the same building entrance from Radcliffe Yard and internal circulation with the Library’s many users and visitors. The building’s existing shared circulation creates routine conflicts between book and other deliveries and the Library’s patrons, staff and visitors.A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would prevent the Schlesinger Library from improving both its collections management and facility operations and the experience of its users. Additionally, as the larger renovation project is designed to facilitate greater public access and interaction with the Library’s collections and exhibits, the inability to separate routine delivery circulation from the activities of the facility’s many researchers and visitors would greatly compromise the Schlesinger Library’s vision of its contemporary research and educational mission. These impacts would present a substantial hardship for the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study as it would negatively impact the Institute’s ability to address its programmatic needs within its existing buildings. The requested zoning relief will allow Radcliffe to better utilize the Schlesinger Library both for its internal operations and the experience of its visitors.","The proposed material lift has been sited unobtrusively within an existing areaway on the James Street side of the building. The new enclosed lift has been designed in a manner that is sensitive to the existing historic building and the adjacent streetscape, and this exterior change was recently approved by the Cambridge Historical Commission. The proposed material lift will result in significant improvements in the Library’s operations, permitting more efficient delivery of research materials directly into the Library’s collections management areas. The new lift also benefits the public by eliminating circulation conflicts with the facilities users and visitors, an important consideration as the Library seeks to increase public access to its collections and exhibits. The proposed project is also consistent with the City’s institutional growth policies which encourage the increased utilization of existing institutional facilities and sites. The planned renovation project will ensure that the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America continues to be one of finest collections documenting the lives of women in the United States.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place and to be altered and expanded. The proposed addition can be readily accommodated on the site in a manner that respects the historic character of the building, and does not impact the adjacent properties or the surrounding neighborhood. The addition of the material lift will not intensify the existing institutional use, but will allow Radcliffe to make more effective use of an existing facility.Therefore, the requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance. Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will further the preservation of a non-conforming historic structure while significantly improving its efficiency and functionality.","The institutional buildings constructed by Radcliffe College in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were sited with their primary orientation to Radcliffe Yard. The buildings are generally located at the periphery of the lot and have a minimal setback to adjacent streets. With the subsequent adoption of zoning controls many of the buildings became non-conforming for front yard setbacks, severely limiting the ability to make even minor additions on their street facing sides.In addition, contemporary special collections facilities like the Schlesinger Library have unique operational needs, such as accommodating regular deliveries of books and other research materials and the need to separate “front” and “back of house” operations, that were not contemplated at the time of the building’s original construction. The original siting of the building and its relationship to adjacent streets limits even minor modifications which may be required for contemporary institutional uses. The combination of the building’s site characteristics and its continued utilization for permitted institutional uses are a condition that does not generally affect properties located in the Residence C-2 zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,05/30/2018

Currently at this location, Webster Bank has signage at the exact same height as what is requested in this application.  The new signage (if approved) would not be out of the norm for what people have become accustomed to at this location.

This limitation reduces the overall square-footage that is allowed for signage for the property while the need for proper wayfinding and identification is actually increased.In addition, the variance that is requested that would allow signage above the height of 20’ from grade is necessary due to the building architecture that exists at this location.  The clearly defined sign band area at this location extends above the 20’ line and is further separated from the code allowed height by an architectural feature that protrudes from the building.

We propose to build two (2) single family houses, wood-framed on top of concrete foundations.","A literal enforcement of the ordinance would involve a financial hardship for the following reasons: The parcel can support a conforming structure that contains three attached touw house style dwelling units.  However, the layout of such a structure would create a long building wall at the front of the site.  This would create a number of hardships.  First, it would cut off the views of open space and much of the natural light to the abutting properties to the east.  Second, it would restrict the dwellers' access to natural light and ventilation primarily to two facades (east and west).  Third, it would restrict dwellers access to open space to the back of the site where an extremely high water table subjects the land to frequent flooding.  To mitigate these issues, Petitioner proposes to build two (2) two detached single-family dwelling units - the second unit would be pushed toward the rear of the site complying with all other dimensional regulations except for the gross floor area of the dsitrict.","Desirable relief may be granted without detriment to the public because the separated two unit design provides for greater light and air for the neighboring abutters because the massing of the structures are not concentrated toward the front/middle of the lot.  Additionally the proposed development will provide greater privacy for the inhabitants of the new structure than a three unit as of right development.  Lastly, the two separate structures are consistent with the neighborhood character and the existing street facade as well as providing better views of open space between the structures.",Relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because the proposed separate structures are very compact and will reduce issues of congestion and overcrowding that are often a concern with in-fill projects in the Residence B zoning district.,"The hardship is owing to the size of the lot and its long and narrow shape such that a less desirable attached three (3) unit town house can be built as of right on the lot.  In order to accommodate a more appropriately scaled redevelopment of the lot that reduces the by right unit count  (two units instead of three) and remains financially practicable, Petitioner request relief from the gross floor area of the district.",,,,,,"Cambridge,",MA,05/21/2014

Without relief Petitioner would not be able to alter the existing porch without a Variance.  The proposed mudroom reduces the setback violation and also encloses the existing unroofed porch allowing for greater privacy for the abutter.,Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good because the house is sited on very large lot and the immediate abutter will not be affected by the proposed mudroom.  Additionally the existing setback violation will be reduced bringing the property into greater conformity with the ordinance.,Desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of this ordinance as the modest mudroom is designed to be consistent with the existing house that is part of the National Register and is similar to other houses in the district.,"The hardship is owing to the siting of the large historic home located on a corner lot such that it violates the side yard setback.

The existing building is a single story. Adding a second level will create a massing that is consistent with the character of the neighborhood.The proposed addition is justified to the corner of Garden and Fenno in order to clarify the street edge and to maintain a buffer space from the two directly adjacent properties.The proposed addition will enhance the residential character of the existing concrete block building and will therefore be more consistent with the character of the neighborhood.,"The intent and purpose of the Ordinance will not be nullified or derogated because the proposed addition seeks no dimensional relief from required setbacks, allowable building height or allowable FAR currently stipulated by the Ordinance.","The property is a corner lot with a trapezoidal shape owing to the fact that the two streets fronting the property meet at an angle.The existing building is aligned to Garden street while the side yard property lines are aligned to Fenno street. Therefore the side yard setbacks occur at an angle to the existing structure and overlap two of the existing building’s corners. In a typical plot in this neighborhood, the side property lines would be perpendicular to the street and their setbacks would be parallel to the building on the the plot.

The other 3 dormers would allow this family to continue to share the 3rd floor comfortably by creating a larger shared bathroom and additional badly needed closet spaces.  the proposed rear deck would provide a needed outdoor space with the only direct connection to their 2nd and 3rd floor unit.

Construction type for proposed screened porch is wood framing.","The current owners have resided at this property since 1990. Both dwelling units are occupied by members of the same extended family. They are seeking a space to enjoy the outdoors--protected from sun, precipitation, and insects--and large enough to seat frequent gatherings of 10-12 family members. Currently there is no screened porch on the property.The Hoefgen-Harvey family is committed to their home and neighborhood, and the addition of a screened porch will allow the family to remain in their home longer. As the family ages, they intend to travel less and use their backyard more. They are also seeking a covered place to protect their outdoor furniture, because storing outdoor furniture in the basement or elsewhere has become increasingly difficult as the owners grow older.Risk from mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) are highest from May through October, and from dusk until dawn. Periods of highest mosquito risk coincide with the seasons and times the owners would most like to enjoy the outdoors: summers and early fall, and dinners during cooler temperatures after sundown.The following information was posted online at the Cambridge Public Health Department website (www.cambridgepublichealth.org):WEST NILE VIRUS (WNV):On July 13, 2017, a mosquito sample in Cambridge tested positive for West Nile Virus.On July 17, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health raised the risk of West Nile Virus infection from “low” to ""moderate"" in Boston, Belmont, Brookline, Cambridge, Newton, and Watertown.“We are advising residents to start taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as wearing repellent or protective clothing in the evening, fixing screens, and eliminating standing water on their property,” said Claude Jacob, the city’s Chief Public Health Officer and director of the Cambridge Public Health Department.The risk of West Nile Virus, which can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito, typically rises through the summer, peaking in August.People over 50 are at greatest risk for serious illness from WNV, especially those with weakened immune systems. Ages of the Hoefgen-Harvey household range from 7 to 84, with three occupants over the age of 50. EASTERN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS (EEE):As of October 10, 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health listed Cambridge in the EEE Risk Category of “REMOTE”. But even in the “REMOTE” category, repairs to insect screens are recommended as a protective measure.Currently there are no available vaccines to prevent human infections from either WNV or EEE. Personal protection measures that serve to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and thereby prevent human infection remain the mainstays of prevention.In Massachusetts over the last ten years, some human EEE cases have occurred outside of the historic area of risk and there have been year-to-year variations in the geographic pattern of disease occurrence. Climate change and warmer seasonal temperatures are expected to increase the risk and expand the range of EEE, and other insect-borne diseases, over time.Outbreaks of EEE usually occur in Massachusetts every 10-20 years. These outbreaks will typically last two to three years. The most recent outbreak of EEE in Massachusetts began in 2004 and included 13 cases with six fatalities through 2006.In Massachusetts, about half of the people identified with EEE died from the infection. People who survive this disease will often be permanently disabled. Few people recover completely.","The proposed screened porch is at the rear of the property, and generally will not be seen by the public. The neighbors living immediately adjacent to the porch at 16-18 Haskell Street—Anne Mock and Chris Chan--have expressed their support, as well as other residents of the neighborhood.There will be no expansion of enclosed, conditioned space; no increase in the total number of occupants; and no decrease of parking on the property.This screened porch would be unlikely to be enclosed in the future because it will be common to both dwelling units, and not directly connected to either unit.The proposed project would increase quality of the housing in the City of Cambridge by improving the livability and appearance of the existing residence.","Relief would ease the constraints presented by this particular, nonconforming property without undermining the overall Ordinance intent.Relief is requested only where necessary. Proposed screened porch otherwise conforms to setback, open space, height, and other zoning requirements. The residential nature of the property will not change.Relief is requested only to help the existing residence provide the Ordinance intent of providing safe conditions for the occupants to enjoy the outdoors, while respecting the surrounding neighborhood.Article 1.30 “PURPOSE” of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance identifies the following desirable purposes: “conserve health”, “conserve the value of land and buildings”, and “encourage the most rational use of land throughout the city, including the encouragement of appropriate economic development.” We believe our proposal satisfies all three of these goals.","The existing single family residence on the property was constructed in 1891, prior to the adoption of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The residence is currently non-conforming with respect to FAR, front yard setback, and side yard setback. Any modification to FAR requires relief.The FAR hardship is specific to the property, and not the surrounding district. Adjacent building lots at 8-10 Haskell (6,995 sq ft), 12-14 Haskell (7,130 sq ft), and 16-18 Haskell (6,535 sq ft) have similar street frontage to this property.

The proposed reduction of parking spaces is consistent with the goals of positive environmental impact and preservation of open space as defined in the Ordinance for the following reasons:   1) Reduction in parking will allow for the addition of bike parking on site, of which there is currently none. This will create a more even mix of accommodations for residents who use different modes of transportation. In addition, the building site benefits from its close proximity to public transportation: it is within 0.3 miles of the Central Square MBTA station and within 500 ft of multiple bus lines. 2) Parking reduction allows for the addition of accessible parking spaces and accessible ramps for building access, of which there are currently none. These accessibility improvements are required by Massachusetts code.  Open space that will be taken up by ramps can be gained back by removing some vehicular parking.   3) Reduction of surface parking decreases the total impervious area on the site, decreasing stormwater runoff and reducing heat island effect.","Because parking spaces will be reduced, traffic volume will not increase due to additional cars. The parking lot in its current state is underutilized and does not reach full capacity. Patterns of access or egress would will remain consistent, as the parking configuration would be largely unchanged.","The proposed enlargement of windows will not have any adverse effect on the neighborhood, as it is an aesthetic improvement to the property.The proposed reduction in parking will not alter the existing multifamily residential use. Adjacent developments/uses will not be negatively impacted because the parking lot is underutilized as-is.","Enlargement of the existing windows is in conformance with all building and life safety codes and will improve upon the environmental (light and air) qualities of the building. The reduction of vehicular parking and addition of bike parking is consistent with the Ordinance’s goals of pedestrian and bicycle-friendly development. This change is a net benefit to the health, safety, and welfare of building residents as well as the City at large.","The proposed reduction in parking will help to bring into balance an already underutilized parking lot. On average, only 12 out of the 45 spaces are used by building tenants, while the rest of the spaces are rented by a mix of neighborhood residents and commuters. The lot is only at 75% capacity on a month-to-month basis. As demonstrated by these statistics, the neighborhood will not be adversely affected by this reduction.",Boston,MA,08/15/2018

The current and proposed use of the property containing a total of six (6) apartment dwelling units is allowed by right.  The existing buildings are dimensionally non-comforming.  The proposed structure in each instance, reduces the existing non-conformities and requires relief from the dimensional and parking requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, Articles 5, ""Development Standards"", Section 5.30, ""District Dimensional Regulations, Residential Districts"" and Article 6, ""Off Street Parking and Loading Requirements"", Section 6.30 ""Parking Quantity Requirements"" only.The apartment buildings, along with many others in the neighborhood, were destroyed by the December 2016 fire and were subsequently condemned by the City of Cambridge Building Commissioner and cannot be reconstructed as they currently exist under any circumstances. Required compliance with the Building Code and Accessibility statutues, rules, regulations and requirements, alone, preclude reconstruction of the existing condition. Therefore, the existing structures must be replaced.  That proposed petition reduces or eliminates the existing non-conformities in each instance and will be compliant with the applicable provisions of the Building Code and Accessibility Requirements.Also, the petitioner cannot enjoy the benefit of pre-existing, non-conforming, ""grand-fathered"" dimensional status for the structure on the property in accordance with the provisions of Zoning Ordinance Article 8.00, ""Nonconformity"" because reconstruction of the property will exceed the original foot prints of the buildings.  The petitioner must seek variances to accomodate the proposed structure.Without the requested dimensional and parking variances resulting in a far superior and desirable development than the existing condition allows, the petitioner will be deprived the by right and pre-existing use of the property for six (6) apartment dwelling units causing a substantial, financial hardship.","The proposed construction of one (1) structure containing six (6) apartment units, provides for three (3) parking spaces and provides for other desirable appurtenances in place of the existing condition (six (6) apartment units in two (2) principal structures which are 2.3' apart providing only one (1) off street parking space) WILL NOT cause any detriment to the public good and will be a marked improvement over the existing condition.Each non-conformity of the existing condition is reduced or eliminated in the case of eliminating the 2.3' foot distance between 2 buildings where 10' is required, which is an improvement to the existing condition.  Also, the proposed use is no different than that which existed prior to the December 2016 fire which destroyed many houses in the neighborhood and, at the very least, no greater impacts to the public detriment are caused by the proposed development.Also, the new structure will be compliant with the current and applicable provisions of the Building Code and Accessibility statutes, rules, regulations and requirements unlike that existing currently.","Zoning Ordinance, Article 1.00, ""Preamble"", Section 1.30, ""Purpose"" sets forth the purpose of the Ordinance.  Among the purposes prescribed, is to lessen congestion in the streets, secure safety from fire, flood, panic, and other danger, to conserve the value of land and buildings, to facilitate the adequate provision of open space, to prevent blight, and to encourage rational use of land. In each instance, the proposed development accomplishes and DOES NOT derogate from the intent of the Zoning Ordinance as prescribed.  Specifically, i) by providing three (3) parking spaces where only one (1) is currently provided, congestion in the streets is lessened; ii) by eliminating two (2) principal structures on the property and putting its place only one (1) which is sprinkled and Building Code compliant in every respect and a nonconformity is eliminated, safety from fire, flood, panic, and other danger is secured; iii) the value of land is conserved by maintaining the current uses with added appurtenances and accommodations; iv) with the addition of courtyards and other appurtenances, open space as a percentage to overall lot area is increased more than 3 times; v) by facilitating the tear down of condemned and uninhabitable structures and replacing them with the proposed structure, blight is prevented; vi) by reducing in each instance, the existing non-conformities, rational use of land is encouraged.  Also, because only modest dimensional variances are sought the effect of which is to reduce, in each instance, or eliminate the existing non-conformities of the current condition, there is no substantial derogation from the intent or purposes of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.","The existing buildings on the property are unique in that there are two (2) principal structures on the property with one (1) accessory parking garage structure.  The smaller dwelling structure is a two (2) family apartment building while the larger dwelling strcuture is a four (4) family apartment building.  Both principal structures stand approximately 2.3' apart. Also, the soil condition of the property is sandy and porous and cannot support redevelopment of the existing, principal structures using basements and foundations as currently exist without significant geo-technical engineering. Proposed in its place is to fill the existing basements and utilize slab on grade construction built with subsurface pilings driven into the ground to ensure adequate structural support of the single, proposed structure which contains the same number of units as currently exist but provides for more parking and other appurtenances.This combination of uniqure conditions related specifically to the property requires replacing the existing condition with a structure, which will, in every instance, reduce the impacts of the existing non-conformities but, which nonetheless, requires relief from the applicable provisions of Zoning Ordinance Articles 5 and 6.",See Attached,See Attached,See Attached,See Attached,See Attached,Peabody,MA,08/09/2018

The Board is also generally authorized under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance to grant special permits when requested changes would not cause traffic issues, do not create effects on the neighborhood that are inconsistent with the character of the neighborhood and its uses, or otherwise adversely affect the safety, health or welfare of the neighborhood or City in general.The petitioner is gut rehabbing and restoring the premises to its original use as two symmetrical dwelling units. This substantial rehabilitation will permit the premises to be compliant with all applicable building codes.  There are two exisitng tandem style parking spaces, only one of which presently conforms to the dimensional requirements of the Ordinance, on the right front of the premises adjacent to 21 Fayette Street. The owners of 21 Fayette Street also utilize the existing curb cut. There is no express easement between the owners of 19 Fayette Street and 21 Fayette Street as to the use of the driveway or the curb cut. By eliminating the second existing, non conforming tandem parking space, use of the existing curb cut/driveway will be significantly less congested and, by eliminating the tandem parking aspect, there will be less congestion and safer mobility of motor vehicles as vehicles will not need to be shuffled out to the street to allow the occupant of the tandem spot to come and go.  By granting the the relief of a second curb cut, the chracter of the neighborhood and its uses will maintain its consistency as most other structures in the neighborhood have off-street parking, thu lessening congestion on the street. This will also create one fully conforming off-street parking space for each unit as required by the Ordinance.","The granting of the curb cut special permit will allow the parking spaces for the premises to be on site, lessening street parking, as is the intent of the Ordinance. Also, permitting relocation of the second parking space to the left front of the premises will reduce congestion with the abutters property and create an organized traffic pattern and parking arrangement causing no detriment to the public interests.","Creation of the parking space associated with the curb cut will not in any way adversely affect the adjacent residential uses which will continue.  The abutter at 21 Fayette Street will actually benefit from the elimination of the second parking space on the premises, access to which occasioanlly traverses over their driveway.","The creation of the second curb cut will replace the existing dimensionally nonconforming tandem parking with a dimensionally conforming parking space, while also lessening congestion around the existing curb cut. The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will also be advanced as parking for the two units will be separate and distinct. There will be no detrimental effect from this change either to the occupants of the proposed use or to the public generally.","The proposed curb cut will be consistent with other dwelling premises in the district, which provide off-street parking. Also, the curb cut will allow the petitioner to preserve the historical and symmetrical front facade of the structure, as otherwise he would need to alter the front facade to provide for a conforming parking spot in front of the building as referenced in the original ""by right"" proposal,  and side by side comparative drawings of which are included in the application. As evidenced by the accompanying letters of support, both the Mid Cambridge Historical Commission and the neighborhood at large have expressed a strong preference for maintaining the symmetry of the historical front facade, whih would be further enhanced by symmetrical parking on each side.  Finally, by granting the relief requested, the macadam under the which the second  tandem parking spot presently sits, will be removed and the area landscaped.  Together with reclaiming some of the green space in the rear,  our proposal will actually increase the over all green open space of the lot.",Cambridge,MA,08/09/2018

The requested 14' dormer is proposed to alleviate the stair headroom problem and to provide adequate space for a second full bathroom in the house. The proposed rear addition replaces an existing sideyard-non-conforming 1950s addition there that acted as a third bedroom on the second floor and as additional enclosed living space on the first floor.The petitioners purchased this house with the two-story rear addition with the understanding that they could renovate the addition. Since its foundation and construction quality is poor, they decided to replace it instead, moving it slightly so that it would conform with its sideyard setbacks.A literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would prevent safe access to the third floor of the house and adequate bathroom facilities for bedrooms there, and would force preservation of a non-conforming house addition.","The proposed dormer is consistent with the City of cambridge dormer guidelines, and with other roof dormers in the neighborhood including one on the same (west) side of the twin house next door to 14 Hubbard (to the east). The proposed 2-story addition at the rear of the house replaces the non-conforming 2-story addition existing on the house with a properly constrcuted, architecturally appropriate, conforming addition.","The west-facing dormer proposed does not increase the neighborhood density since it is to be constructed on the roof over an alreafy finished third floor. Between it and the next, nearest structure, and apartment building, there is substantial distance, approximately 25', consisting of two driveways. The proposed rear addition replaces an existing rear addition that is both in severe disrepair and in violation of the sideyard setback. The proposed replacement is a substantial improvement.","The existing house, though it contains a full finished stairway to a finished third floor, was not constructed with adequate stair headroom. The C-1 zoning district allows 2367 sf of house floor area, and the proposed total square footage is 2011 sf. Because the house was constructed prior to adoption of the Ordinance it does not conform to current sideyard setbacks. Petitioner is requesting floor area that totals 34o sf less than the Ordinance allows.","The proposed window at the second floor on the east side of the house is the same size as the two other second floor windows on that side of the house.  It is proposed in order that a small family space can be made at that floor.

They purchased 10 Arlington Street last year because of its potential as a welcoming family house, and its ready access to public transportation. It is also a house in sore need of renovation and deferred maintenance, and the Stodolskys have hopes of bringing it back to its original beauty. They have large families who visit frequently from elsewhere in the United States and two sets of elderly parents who stay with them for extended periods of time. The house is an attached house, one of a pair on Arlington Street, and as such has a long and narrow footprint that grows narrower in the rear. A previous renovation, perhaps in the 1960s, moved the kitchen into what would traditionally have been thought of as the living room, the front room facing the street, undoubtedly to make a family room in the rear ell that faces south and connects to the ample backyard. The Stodolskys, by means of a modest 120SF addition at the first floor, want to move the kitchen back into its more appropriate location at the rear of the house but with slightly more elbow room for the many family members who participate in cooking together. The addition would also serve to accomodate the coming and going of people, coats, and groceries, by making a crucial side door and boot room. At the second floor, the Petitioners are requesting 60 SF more space in order to make a second bathroom at that floor. At the third floor, the Petitioners are requesting 38 SF more space divided between a small shed dormer at the front/street side of the house where a skylight exists now, and an extension of an existing shed dormer at the rear of the house. Neither of the third floor bedrooms has, in their existing state, enough Code-worthy (7') headroom to satisfy the Code requirement that a habitable room must have at least 7' of 7' height space in both directions.","The proposed additions are modest in size and careful in their location on the building and site. They do not cast shadow on adjacent properties, they do not create more bedrooms than the house has presently, and they are designed with an appropriate scale and subservience to the existing original building. They have been approved by the Avon Hill Neighborhood Conservation District Commission. Contrary to being detrimental to the public good, minimal additions that encourage and accomodate the life of a normal family actually serves the public good, and so will the renovations that the Stodolskys are undertaking. No density is increased nor traffic intensified due to the proposal.","The proposal does not adversely affect the health or safety of the citizens of Cambridge, nor the value of anyone's property, and it does not seek to take advantage of the size of the house or land.","The house at 10 Arlington Street is in the Avon Hill Neighborhood Conservation District. It is a long and narrow site, and like many lots in Cambridge falls short of the required lot size of 5000 SF in the Residence B district in which it's located. The house sports a large covered front porch that currently is counted in the floor area although the historic district commission regulations forbid the porch ever becoming living space.

The existing property is non-conforming with respect to minimum lot area, minimum lot width, and front and side yard setbacks. Therefore the proposed improvements can only be built with a Variance. The additional floor area will allow for a family room/eating area on the first floor, and new bathrooms on the second floor. The new porch and mudroom at the rear door and the enlarged front door roof will allow for convenient and safe access, especially with children. These proposed improvements will allow for better and safer family use of the property, both the new rear yard and the house itself. They will also help justify the costs of the purchase price and the renovations. Therefore a literal enforcement of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship.","No detriment to the public good is seen as a result of the proposed addition. The project actually will reduce the amount of building on the site, by removing the garage, and will also increase the amount of open space, which will remove the existing minimum open space non-conformity.","The proposed addition is architecturally compatible with the existing structure and the neighborhood. This modest addition will allow for the house to be renovated for family living, with appropriate kitchen and family room space, a small mudroom at the rear door, and two bedrooms and two baths on the second floor. The additional area will also allow for a new code-compliant stair to replace the steep and dangerous existing stair, and a playroom in the new basement. The footprint of the addition is 205 square feet, which is more than offset by the removal of the existing 334 square foot garage. The existing 7.4 foot setback will be maintained on the east side, and the addition will only be 12 feet wide in order to provide a 5.5 foot setback on the west side. The proposed rear yard will provide a play area for children, comprising over 1,00 square feet of open space. The property will remain a single-family residence. The pedestrian traffic and patterns of access and egress will be essentially unchanged. The front of the house, the only part of the property visible from Franklin Street, will not be changed, except to enlarge the existing roof over the front door by 9 square feet. The addition will not cause a congestion hazard, or a change in the character of the neighborhood. The proposed addition will have no adverse affect of the adjacent uses, and will not result in the creation of any nuisance or hazard. The proposed improvements are generally in keeping with properties in the neighborhood, and therefore would not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining districts, nor would they derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance. The proposed removal of the existing garage and pavement are seen as significant improvements to the existing condition from the neighbor’s point of view. The Owners respectfully submit that this variance may be granted without compromising the purpose of the Ordinance as stated in Article 1, Section 30.","A Variance is requested due to the hardship created by the existing circumstances relating to the shape and topography of the land and structures with regard to required lot area and width, and front and side setbacks, particularly affecting this property.

This facde violates the minimum rear yard setback requirement for this zoning district. Unusually, however, the building to the east, adjacent to the facade of 45 Bellevue in question, is constructed on a poiece of land considerably lower in grade than that of 45 Bellevue. It has only a small back room window in that, its west facade, and therefore has no line-of-sight to the proposed changes at 45  Bellevue. The two proposed bedroom windows replace an existing ""piano""-type window (a horizontal window with a higher-than-typical sill height) in the room. The proposed bedroom windows will bring additional light into the bedroom, and provide additional fresh air, while causing no detriment to the house, adjacent building, nor to the citizens of Cambridge. The window that is proposed to move and reduce in size is proposed due to a change in the existing stairwell. The Owners of this property, Elizabeth Bartle and David Boghossian, experienced a devastating fire at this house a year ago, and are in the process of re-constructing the entire house interior and some of the exterior. While executing a renovation that respects the architecture of the original house, they are attemting to correct some previous modernizations that were historically (and pragmatically) insensitive.",No more traffic will be generated nor patterns of access altered by this proposal.

The only other building on the lot is a masonry garage 20.0 x 48.5 feet.,"For the past thirty years I (the petitioner) have occupied the third floor of a three family house that I own. Its primary spaces are arranged along a dormer on the Granite Street side (south side). Unfortunately, this creates a difficult plan that is a series of rooms along the south side with the north relegated to a head bumping, cramped bath, stairs, bedroom and storage area. With the addition of 153 sq. ft. of dormer on the north side I would be able to rearrange the unit in a much more workable way, allow for cross-ventilation and add a much needed bedroom/office. Because of the narrowness of the lot, the building is also narrow and the third floor is even more confined. This makes it a very difficult unit to lease (hence I live there), but with the addition of the 153 sq. ft. the unit would become much more attractive either for me or for other tenants.","The proposed addition is only 153 sq. ft. and only increases the FAR by .03. Although it is over the allowable FAR for the zone, very few houses in that area are actually close to being under it (see accompanying table).  The addition is on the third floor, will take away no open space, have very little impact on the neighbors, and adequate parking is provided off street. Although it will add one bedroom, the quality of the unit will be improved in the hope that the quality of tenants will also improve.","The goal of a zoning ordinance is to maintain the existing positive qualities of a neighborhood while allowing change that can be beneficial. As shown by the table of the FAR of neighboring properties, the proposed change will not be very different from the density of the neighbors. Although the addition will add a small amount of square footage, it will be in character with the community,  it will not have any negative impact on the neighbors and will add positive housing stock to the area.","The building is located in a dense neighborhood of Cambridgeport at the intersection of Granite and Rockingham Streets.  The site itself is very narrow (36.67 feet) which makes it very difficult to have a conforming building that does not infringe on the setbacks in some significant way. It also demands a narrow building that, given its gable configuration, makes the third floor a confining space. In order to relieve the awkwardness of the third floor created by the narrowness of the lot and hence the narrowness of the building, I am requesting permission to build a dormer on the north side of the building similar to the one on the south side.  In discussions with all my neighbors (including showing them the plans) we are all in agreement that the proposed addition would have minimal impact on the neighborhood and would make my unit a more viable place to rent or live.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,07/09/2014

Specifically, the proposal will reduce the total number of windows (and therefore the total area of windows at the side of the dwelling), the size will be similar to existing windows or smaller, the placement of the windows will provide more privacy to the abutting dwelling as it will no longer align with the abutter’s windows instead new windows will face the abutter’s exterior siding. Lastly, we have performed community outreached by contacting the abutters most affected by this change.","In keeping to the character of the neighborhood and the existing architecture of the structure, the relocated windows will be installed with similar trim to match the rest of the house.

The proposal is located at the side of the dwelling where similar windows exist, therefore the only impact to the community may be the abutter. Care has been taken to align the new window location, such that the windows face the abutter’s siding rather than an existing window since the abutter’s setback is also less than the 7’6” requirement.

Literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would involve substantial hardship because:•	They will not be able to gain sufficient living space to accommodate significant life style changes without creating the proposed attic living space, 2nd floor laundry, and 2nd floor office. Numerous alternate designs were considered, but all required variance relief, or were unworkable or less desirable in terms of functionality and negative impacts to abutters. •	If the goals of the addition cannot be met, Petitioners, who have multi-generational ties to this home and this neighborhood, will need to move, disrupting their long-standing connections with the City, the Strawberry Hill neighborhood and Holworthy Street (described below). Lifestyle Changes: Petitioners have lived in the house for 28 years, during which they both worked fulltime jobs requiring long hours and frequent travel. Consequently, they did not spend much time actually at home. Martha has retired and Robert now works from home. They have found that the house does not have sufficient space to accommodate their at-home needs, interests, and family visits. The goal of their proposal is to create a house that allows them to age in place, is a comfort and pleasure to live in, has a welcoming exterior and entranceway, preserves privacy for them and their neighbors, and has traditional design elements. Through careful design, they have sought to create additional space without simply building a “big box” to gain square footage, and instead to design a home that is compatible with the surrounding homes and is appealing but does not “look out of place” on the street.  Connections to City and Neighborhood: Petitioners have a strong connection and attachment to the house, Strawberry Hill neighborhood, and the City. The house was built by Robert’s grandparents, Anna and Raymond Patten, in 1958. Robert’s family has lived on Holworthy Street and the surrounding blocks back as many as five generations. Robert and Martha have both worked in Cambridge for many years, and have developed strong bonds in their neighborhood of Strawberry Hill.","The proposed house will not result in substantial detriment to the public good. The proposed cross-gable colonial house front facade and roof pitch complement nearby one- and two-family homes (see photographs in Figures 5 and 6).The mass, shape, height, and roofline of the proposed renovation is more consistent, with most neighborhood homes, than the existing house and consequently will fit in with neighborhood better than the existing home.The existing back yard open space is maintained and provides relief from building density for the Petitioners and also their abutters (see photographs in Figures 3 and 7).Based on comparison to 11 neighboring one- and two-family houses comprising the Hearing Notice List, the proposed building’s footprint, gross floor area, and FAR are all below the midpoint and the average of the range of the Notice List houses.  The percent private open space (most of which can be seen by abutting houses), is above the midpoint and the average of the range of the Notice List houses, and will be remain so after the proposed construction.There will be no change in occupancy, therefore no additional cars will impact street congestion or parking. There will be no impact on solar systems now or in the future because the house will not be higher than buildings to the east, north or west.Finally, a growing family can use the proposed house, without expansion in the future, thereby improving the housing stock of Cambridge and aligning with a general goal of the City.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Maintain valued open space for the benefit of the petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Help conserve the value of this building and conserve natural resources by providing the necessary upgrades to the existing home’s primary systems, windows, and insulation•	Help conserve the value of surrounding buildings by maintaining open space.•	Improve the housing stock of Cambridge through creation of a home that allows the next owners to raise a young family in Cambridge, “therefore it will preserve and increase the amenities of the City”•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The house is a pre-existing nonconforming structure owing to the small (4,125 sf.) lot size and shape (narrowing from front to back of lot); the Lot Area and existing side yard setbacks do not meet current dimensional requirements. The topography of the lot, which rises 10 feet from behind the house to the rear lot line, as shown in Figures 3 and 4, impacts potential for expansion to the back. The steep slope behind the house requires two sets of retaining walls. The back slope, the retaining walls, and the small side yards limit the possibilities of expansion of the house to the rear or to the sides because of problems of access to the back yard for construction equipment and materials, difficulties and increased costs associated with excavation for a new foundation, cutting into the back retaining walls, and generating excess volumes of soil that would need to be transported off-site, chemically tested and disposed. Furthermore, expanding into the back yard (without further violating the side yard setbacks) would require bringing the side walls in towards the center of the property, resulting in an awkward floor plan layout and an architecturally unattractive house. Finally such construction would greatly reduce the open space of the back yard.FAR – The Petitioners evaluated alternative designs for achieving the needed additional living space (that might be achieved under the FAR limit of 0.5).  However, they found that even the simplest scenario of expanding the second floor from a ¾ story to a full second floor and providing an adequately sloped gable roof resulted in additional GFA and an FAR over 0.5, and would not provide the space and rooms needed.","The proposed renovation includes altering and adding windows in the nonconforming side setbacks to accommodate the altered and new room configurations and provide natural light and ventilation, requiring special permit relief in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.  The proposed window placement will afford the adjacent neighbors increased privacy over the current window placement by increasing the off-set from the East neighbor’s existing windows and decreasing the window size in the case of the second floor West wall windows.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character because the proposed house will continue as a single-family house as the Petitioners’ home.",No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed remodeling of the house and altered and new window placement will not adversely affect neighboring uses.,Use of the house and property will continue as a single-family house and yard. No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed renovation project or by the future use of the property by the Petitioners.,"A change of use is not proposed and the house will continue as a single-family house, therefore the use of the house will not impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district.",Boston,MA,12/12/2018

The new penthouse will be clad in copper which is the same as the existing penthouse and will be set slightly lower than the existing penthouse.,"A literal compliance of Section 6.48.1(a) would create a hardship primarily due to the dimensional limitations of the site. The site cannot meet the designated landscapes requirement and provide space for a future compost struction and meet the requirements for a bicycle rack, as required by the City of Cambridge. Full compliance with Section 6.48. 1(a) would require the elimination of the composting struction and bicycle rack, which would result in another non-comformity.","The public good of providing a compliant handicapped accessible parking space, a bicycle rack and area for a future composting structureis notable. The benefits of a planted landscape screening as opposed to a asolid fence to meet the screening requirements creates a warm and welcoming environment for the residents ans neighbors. The existing small landscaped island has a healthy honey locust tree that is appropriately sized for the existing parking lot which a public benefit for the neighbors and resident at the property. Due to the spacing requirements for compliant parking spaces, enlarging the existin island to comply with the 5% landscaped requirement will result in the loss of amenities, a less desireable screening solution, and an unbalanced design for the existing landscaped island, all of which would be detrimental to the abutting properties and the visual appearance of the property.","The applicant believes the intent of this section of the ordinance is to provide visual relief, rain water absorption and shading for larger parking facilities. The shading helps to relieve the ""heat island"" effect in urban areas and beautifies parking areas. Since there is already an established healthy honey locust tree on the lanscaped island, which will be retained, the applicant believes that enlarging the landscaped island will not have any influence on the heat-island effect. Also, the landscaped buffer screen area are equally valuable in absorbing rain water and relieving the heat-island effect as an increased island would provide. The inten and purpose of the Ordinance represented in Section 6.48.1(a) will not in any way be nullified of derogated.","Section 6.48.1(a) requires 5% of the parking facility to be landscaped. The existing site has an exceedingly tight layout and has only one landscaped island which contains a landscaped area of 2.59% of the parking lot. The applicant's proposed changes to the lot are intended to correc the drainage flow, correct handicapped accessible grading, and correct the arrangement of the hanicapped parking spaces to comply with the can accessible requirements per the MAAB Rules and Regulations. To fully comply with the 5% requirement, a hardship would be created for the project becuase there is not enough room on the site to provide space for a future composting struction and a bicycle rack. The only way to meet Section 6.48.1(a) would be to demolish the existing 5' landscaped screening buffer at one end or the other of the existing parking lot and install a solid screening fence to meet the screening requirement. As a result, the area for the bicycle rack and an area designaed for the future compost struture would be eliminated, which to reiterate would create a different non-conformity.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,12/20/2018

Due to the existing interior location of stairs to the basement and narrow lot, the side entryway must be constructed within the side yard setback – 4.6 feet from the right side of the lot.  A literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting them from making desirable improvements to the interior of the home, which include removal of a current “illegal” second apartment in the basement, and removal of unnecessary basement egress stairs at the front of the building that are reducing valuable living space at the front, first floor of the house.","The relief from Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because it would be a very minimal change – a new shed-style entryway at the side of the house, tucked behind the front section of the house, and nearly invisible to the public.  There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioners to proceed with plans to remove an “illegal” basement apartment, and improve the design for this single-family house, resulting in housing stock that will be suitable to residents with families.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will: allow owners to renovate and improve quality single-family housing within existing footprint on an undersized lot, for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners; not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance; not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the interior layout of the structure in terms of access to the basement via a bulkhead entry located within the side yard setback, the narrow sized lot, and the structure’s location very close to the right side of the lot.  These unique circumstances result in Petitioner requiring relief to make a very modest and necessary change to the basement access way on the right side of the structure.","The proposed renovation includes enlarging attic windows on either side of the main portion of the house, as well as a new window above the doorway on the left side of the house.  These window alterations will occur within the pre-existing nonconforming side setbacks, and are necessary to improve natural light and air ventilation on the attic level, and in the entry to the home, and require special permit relief in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.  The window improvements should have very limited impact on abutters due to the relatively minimal increased size of the window openings and locations of these windows offset from the neighbors’ windows.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character, but will vastly improve the conditions within the home.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed remodeling of the house, and adjacent uses will not be adversely affected by the requested special permit relief.","No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the windows at the attic level exist currently and will only be modestly increased in size, and new window above left side entry will be in a location adjacent to the current parking area, with little impact on the neighbor.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the window enlargement and new window will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.",Boston,MA,12/20/2018

The building is being constructed on land acquired from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to allow for the growth of the Hult Business School and create a productive use for land previously used by the Department of Conservation and Recreation for a temporary and outmoded operations and maintenance facility. The building is being constructed pursuant to a Special Permit issued by the Cambridge Planning Board on August 15, 2017 (PB # 328).	The building is hemmed in by elevated highways on two sides and by a high-rise condominium tower and MWRA sewage pump station on its other sides. It is at the extreme eastern edge of Cambridge in an area cut-off from the rest of the Cambridge by a trestle for the MBTA Green Line and cut off from Charlestown by MBTA rail tracks. A maintenance and operations facility is now under construction for the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation immediately adjacent to the building location under the highway ramps. Literal enforcement of the signage regulations contained in Article 7.000 of the Ordinance would impose a substantial hardship on the Hult Business School as a result of its separation from the community, as well as its distance and lack of visibility from main streets and public transportation.  Because of the isolated location and nearby physical and visual obstructions, as one approaches the building by foot, bicycle or car, the lower levels of the building are not visible from Monsignor O’Brien Highway, which is the roadway that must be used to access the building, nor is the bottom of the building visible from any of the four nearby transit stations (Lechmere, North Station, Science Park, Community College) where students, employees and visitors arrive in the neighborhood. Because of the lack of visibility, building identification signs at the maximum height permitted as of right (20 feet) would not adequately serve to direct students, employees and visitors.  Because the signs must be higher up on the building in order to adequately serve a way-finding function, they must also be larger than the maximum size permitted as of right (60 square feet) so that they can be seen from the ground level at the distances necessary for members of the public to locate the building and guide themselves toward this isolated location. 	The proposed sign has been designed to have the smallest impact while serving the necessary function to identify the location of the building. The sign has been located specifically to face the Community College Orange Line transit station, and to be visible from the westbound pedestrian sidewalk on the Gilmore Bridge.  The Community College station and this sidewalk are used by the largest numbers of students, employees and visitors to reach the EF Campus.  The signage will consist of the name “Hult” painted on a panel attached to the rooftop screening, with a steel outline of the Hult Business School crest located on the building wall below. The crest has been included in the signage at the suggestion of neighbors as a distinctive decorative feature on the building’s facade. The Hult name sign will be illuminated by modest external uplighting and the crest will be illuminated by external back lights so they can be seen early in the morning and in the evening (until 9 p.m., when the lighting will be turned off) in order to serve its function during the majority of hours when students, employees and visitors are traveling to the building. This is particularly important because the Community College transit station is located across the I-93 highway ramps and the Gilmore Bridge and it is especially difficult for drivers and pedestrians to navigate across and through the elevated roadways to reach the building. 	Section 7.11.1(G) of the Ordinance recognizes that “the public interest is served by the use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available, or to display noncommercial messages.”  Like a business, the Hult Business School relies on signage to direct employees, students and visitors to its location and to establish its identity in the community.  In addition, the building will also be the site of a public gym facility and outdoor athletic facilities which will draw additional numbers of visitors to the site. These facilities are being constructed as a community benefit under M.G.L. c.91 and agreements made with the Commonwealth and the City of Cambridge for the development of the project.  The limited amount of signage permitted under the Ordinance is suitable for typical Cambridge locations marked by dense development and heavily trafficked streets.  In these areas, buildings and businesses are readily identifiable by passers-by on foot or traveling by bicycle or in vehicles, which is not the case in the physically isolated area in which the Hult Business School is located.  	As an international school with associated educational, cultural exchange and international travel programs, the Hult Business School has students, employees and visitors coming to the building at all hours of the day.  Many of these visitors are from other cities and countries (as well as other parts of the Boston metro area) and are unfamiliar with Cambridge and the North Point area.  Between 40% and 45% of all students, workers and visitors traveling to the Hult/EF campus arrive via the Community College station, consistent with the policy goals of the City of Cambridge and the Ordinance.  Although GPS and the internet can help people identify the building location prior to arriving in the neighborhood, the fact remains that once on the ground in the vicinity of the building, the local street network with its web of highway ramps, elevated railroad trestles, industrial sites such as Boston Sand & Gravel and high rise buildings can be confusing and disorienting.  The Hult Business School has been at its existing building at 1 Education Street since 1997 and it is still a common occurrence for visitors attending classes, meetings and trainings to have difficulty finding the building, as it is for cab or car-share drivers arriving to pick up staff, students and visitors after evening classes or meetings. This creates a substantial hardship for an international school that has been a pioneer in a far corner of the City and is now choosing to expand its operations there.",,"The proposed signage on Hult’s new building will not result in a substantial detriment to the public good, nor will it nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  As noted in Section 7.11.1(G) of the Ordinance, “the public interest is served by the use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available, or to display noncommercial messages.”  In accordance with Section 7.11.1, the Ordinance regulates the signs in order to “preserve and enhance the substantial governmental interests of the City of Cambridge in its natural, scenic, historic, cultural, aesthetic qualities.”  This is consistent with the overall purpose of the Ordinance to conserve the value of land and buildings by preserving and enhancing the appearance of buildings, areas, parks, public streets and other public properties, as well as encouraging appropriate economic development (such as the growth of the Hult Business School and associated job creation).  See Ordinance, Section 1.30 and 7.11.1.  The signage proposed by Hult is appropriate in both its scale and aesthetic impact.  EF, on behalf of the Hult Business School, has worked with the East Cambridge Planning Team and the neighbors at the Regatta Condominium to design signage that is not obtrusive.  By being responsive to community concerns in this manner, the proposed signage has received the support of both groups and is consistent with the public good and with the intent and purpose of Article 7.00 and the Ordinance generally.  	EF’s development of the building for the Hult Business School has benefitted from widespread support of the community, in large part due to the significant public benefits offered by the project.  The building is replacing an unsightly DCR operations and maintenance facility and providing the funds for a new facility to be constructed in a location where it has lesser impacts on the community. The public athletic facilities that have been incorporated in the project will provide new recreational opportunities for Cambridge residents and attract additional users to the North Point Park. A large gym with a rock climbing wall will be located on the ground floor of the building that will be open to the public as well as Hult staff and students and EF employees. All portions of the site that are not used for the building, driveways and bicycle storage (a minimum of 65,000 square feet) will be improved with public green space and park improvements above and beyond typical landscaping improvements for a commercial building, including: •	an outdoor fitness course around the building,•	a flex field that can accommodate a 5 vs 5 soccer match and other planned or impromptu activities,•	a passive park on the west side of the site,•	a sports track for outdoor fitness activities such as 40-yard sprints and exercise classes,•	pedestrian pathways, benches or other seating and sidewalk connections. EF has also agreed to construct improvements that will directly benefit bicycle and pedestrian travel in and around the area, and to make additional payments totaling $500,000 to be used for park purposes.  In order for the building to be successful in attracting additional visitors and activating the community amenities to be provided in connection with this project, the building must be identifiable and easy to find.  As noted above, the Board of Zoning Appeal has previously found that variances may be granted for wall signs at 1 Education Street and 2 Education Circle without substantial detriment to the public good or nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.","The hardship for this particular building is a result of its unique location, the surrounding structures and topography, and the lack of a well-travelled street grid. These are not characteristics that are generally common to East Cambridge.  The site is literally at the “dead end” of Cambridge where the streets are cut off by the interstate highway and multiple railroad tracks and there is no through traffic.  The building’s location is separated from the community by the Interstate-93 highway ramps, the Gilmore Bridge, the tall towers of the Regatta Riverview Condominiums, and the Green Line railroad trestles on the Monsignor O’Brien Highway. Its closest neighbor is an MWRA sewage pump station and a maintenance and operations facility that is now under construction for the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.  Signage meeting the height and area requirements of the Ordinance would not be visible except in the immediate vicinity of the building and would therefore not serve any significant purpose.  These structures and uses serve as a physical and psychological barrier between the location of the building and the remainder of the East Cambridge neighborhood, as well as Charlestown and the Community College transit stop.  	As is demonstrated by Hult’s experience at its existing building, visitors who are not already on Education Street or the North Point Boulevard Extension will often have difficulty seeing the building and finding their way there without signage that can be seen from farther away.  In fact, it is common for Hult staff to use neighborhood identifiers with large elevated signs such as the Museum of Science, the Royal Sonesta and Boston Sand & Gravel in order to instruct visitors to its location and none of these are visible from the Community College transit station or the Gilmore Bridge.  The sign that is proposed at the top of the building façade is therefore necessary in order for the building to be identifiable from main, travelled public ways and must be larger in order to be seen from these areas.  There is significant supporting precedent both in Cambridge and under Massachusetts case law (see e.g. Conlon v. Rosa, 2008 WL 4968874 (Mass. Land Ct., November 21, 2008)) that larger signs may be warranted where a site is set back from main through-streets or separated by natural and man-made features such as surrounding buildings, and that a substantial hardship is created where these larger signs are not permitted.  The Board found this to be the case when it granted sign variances for Hult’s existing building at 1 Education Street in 1999 (Case No. 7928) and the EF North American Headquarters located at 2 Education Circle in 2013 (Case No. 10418).  Many of the same considerations apply to this new building.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,06/28/2019

The front door remains Ms. Lloyd’s primary egress in and out of thehouse, given that parking is on the other side of the house. Currently, that front door area of thehouse has no storage. The new structure would contain a small storage area. The new enclosurewill also provide for significant energy savings as this will create an airlock between the exteriorand the interior living space.The house was certainly originally built as a 2 family structure. At some point it was convertedto a single family structure, but without modifying the existing stair layout to the 2nd floor, norwith any consideration for energy efficiency. Consequently, the existing front door opensdirectly into the living space, with the stairs to the 2nd floor very close to the front door. Becauseof this tight configuration, there is no possibility of creating this storage or airlock inside theexisting footprint of the house. The proposed new addition would remedy these issues. Theexisting structure is already slightly non-conforming with respect to the front yard setback. Theproposed new structure would further encroach into the required 15’ front yard setback, butwould remedy the current difficulties.The existing house, with its current covered entry porch, is also non-conforming with regard tothe minimum 7’-6” left side setback. The current distance to the property line is approximately4’-0”. The proposed modest addition does not increase the existing side yard setback nonconformity.The existing house is already non-conforming with regard to F.A.R. However, this is due to thefact that the basement of this house is slightly over 7’ in height, and therefore is counted in theG.F.A. The modest increase of 68 square feet created by the proposed addition, addsapproximately 1 percent to that F.A.R. number, which is a reasonable request for the lifestylegain this will afford the owner.A similar request for a modification to this house was made by Ms. Lloyd to this Board in 2003(case nos. 8767 and 8770) and was granted. At that time, the Owner chose not to perform thework due to personal reasons.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good. To the contrary, the proposed additionwill provide an aesthetically pleasing and more energy efficient contribution to the community.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of theOrdinance. Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its purpose,among many things, “to conserve the value of land and building, including the conservationof natural resources…” Specifically, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as thismodest modification will keep the design and the spirit of the street intact. In both a general andspecific sense, the proposal neither nullifies nor derogates from the intent of purpose of theOrdinance.","The construction of this house in 1924 (according the Cambridge Assessor’s Database) predatesthe current zoning and clearly any current understanding of energy efficiency. The front doorarea, as the primary entry point for the house, is underserved with respect to storage, and isenergy-inefficient. The modest modification proposed here will not affect generally the zoningdistrict in which it is located. The major plane of the front of the building does not change, andthe sense of setback from the street will, by and large, remain unchanged. The proposedextension of the front vestibule into the front yard setback is also not out of keeping with otheradjacent and nearby building, which also encroach upon the setback.","Janet Lloyd, the appellant and owner of 235 Lexington Avenue, wishes to make a veryminor modification to two windows on the north face of her home. The plane of thesewindows sit within the minimum 7’-6” side yard setback for this lot (and beyond theminimum 3’-0” requirement as set forth by Massachusetts Building Code), and thereforerequire a special permit for their modification. Requirements of the Ordinance will bemet since no change will be made to the plane and no increase of the existing nonconformity.Modification of the windows will also provide a positive impact on the internalorganization of the house, as well as organize some asymmetry on the exterior façade.",Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Not applicable.,Cambridge,MA,07/11/2014

We, the owners of each 41/43 and 45 Magoun St, intend to record the easement at the Registry of Deeds once we receive the special permit. We also intend to apply for a curb cut permit, whose ordinance requirements are met through our plan and application.","The granting of the special permit, and eventually the curb cut permit, will allow for parking spaces on our own properties and off the street, thus improving the availability of street parking. Our proposal would remove more cars from the street than could park in the length of the curb cut, thus easing congestion. Moreover, we have already spoken with our abuttors, and all we have heard from have provided their approval (see attachment). Lastly, almost all homes on Magoun Street have a curb cut and off-street parking; as such the neighborhood character would not change (see attachment with images).","Creation of the parking from the driveway and the curb cut will not adversely affect the adjacent residential uses. In fact, we as applicants are each the adjacent neighbor that would be most impacted, and we are seeking to create this driveway together for each of our mutual benefits. Properties behind will not be affected as the driveway will not go into the backyard. Abuttors have provided approval for the project.","The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41/43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times. We at 45 Magoun Street are seniors and would like easier access to our cars. Paul is deaf in one ear and has only 40% hearing in the other, making it difficult to hear the fast oncoming traffic when entering the car. In addition, our parked car on the street was recently banged on the side by someone driving down the street. It was extremely stressful to deal with the aftermath and resistance from the insurance company. The parking space will also enable better public health and clean air, as it will open up the opportunity for electric cars and less emissions. We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally.","Curb cuts, off-street driveways, and even mutual driveways are common in North Cambridge. We include here photos from our most proximate neighborhood (North Cambridge north of the linear bike path). As such, the proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district, but in fact improve the safety of both the occupants and provide more street parking to others. There is one small tree, about 4-5 inch caliper (less than the 6"" mentioned in the ordinance), that would need to be moved or removed for the curb cut; we include here in our design a plan to either move it to either side of the curb cut, or plant a new one, as per the City’s advice.",Cambridge,MA,09/11/2020

They took what was a two-family structure in below average condition and, with the help of local tradesmen and a lot of their own sweat-equity, created a single family home for their family.  At the time they purchased the property, there was a partial roof over the existing second floor deck, but it was in poor repair.   As part of their as-of-right renovation they removed that small roof, but left the existing structure in place.  Now, after having lived in the house for 2 years, the Owners are requesting a variance to rebuild that roof to provide adequate weather protection for the new door that was installed for what is now the master bedroom, as well as to protect the rear side of the house, with its various openings, from the weather.  The variance is necessary since the new G.F.A. exceeds the allowable by 98 square feet.  The variance is also required since the new roof will encroach on the left side setback by approximately two feet.The existing house is conforming in all respects, except with regard to the left side setback.  This side yard non-conformity is not uncommon in this neighborhood.  The current distance to the property line is approximately 4’-6”.  The proposed modest addition of the partial deck roof does not increase the existing side yard setback non-conformity.A literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would not allow this modest increase.  The placement of a roof over a portion of this 2nd floor deck would provide needed weather protection for the house, as well as a more desirable shading for the Owner.  And it would be unlikely that this covered area would be enclosed in the future since it would leave a remaining portion of the 2nd floor deck exposed that would be less than 3 feet in depth.","Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  The proposed modification is on the back of the house, and generally will not be seen by the public.  And the proposed modest roof will protect the building, adding to its longevity.","The granting of relief will neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its purpose, among many things, “to conserve the value of land and building, including the conservation of natural resources…”  Specifically, the intent of the Ordinance will be respected, as this modest modification does not affect the general design of the house or the neighborhood, and will protect the building resource for a longer time.  In both a general and specific sense, the proposal neither nullifies nor derogates from the intent of purpose of the Ordinance.","The construction of this house in 1925 included a roof over the same area that the Owner’s wish to rebuild.  This provided the same protections from the elements and shading that the current Owners desire.  The downzoned conversion of this structure from a two family to a single family residence obviously modified the internal layout of the house.  The original design did not anticipate this type of legal conversion.  It is not unreasonable that this original roof be replaced, to provide the now master bedroom with this protection from the elements to the northeast.  The modest addition does not affect the zoning district in which it is located, as many of these structures in the B zone have similar roofs over rear decks.",,,,,,CAMBRIDGE,MA,07/11/2014

In embarking on an appropriately sized kitchen and bedroom expansion at the rear of the house, and because their 1930 metal garage is succombing to rust and disintegration, they would like to rebuild a garage of identical footprint, but need its location to be in compliance with the Ordinance rule of a 10' distance between it and the primary structure. So, they are requesting permission to build a compliant new garage building of identical footprint.  The Owners have depended on their garage for not only car storage in harsh winters, but for bicycles, car needs, the lawn mower, tools, and all the commonplace things that are most easily stored outside the house. A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would serve to deny modest convenience to long-time, civic-minded engaged citizens at just the moment when it is likely that they will be spending more and more time at home.","A single car garage has existed at 11 Buckingham Street since 1930. The proposed new garage is sited 14' back from the location of the existing garage. The new location is adjacent to the existing garage belonging to the neighboring property to the south, number 9 Buckingham Street. The Owners feel that the increased distance from the street and the proximity of the two garages is beneficial to the public.","Since a garage on the property is an established use for 89 years, granted relief, contrary to nullifying or substantially derogating from the purpose of the Ordinance, would simply enhance the safety of the occupants of the house, decrease visibility from the street to the public, and keep unchanged the everyday and modest storage abilities of the Owners.","The width of the lot at 11 Buckingham Street is 58' in a district that requires 80'. This is likely because, in 1919, the Owners of number 13 Buckingham to the north, a considerably larger, grander, and elevated house, lopped off their land and the south appendage of their house and moved them south to be a new elementary schoool. That lopped off site is the land under number 11, which was converted into a single family house, probably around 1925. Our Ordinance, because it recognizes that residents need to store cars, bikes, and tools outside of the house, rightly and wisely does not include single car garages as part of a property's floor area. The lot area at this property is more than the district required minimum. Many Cambridge properties that meet neither lot width nor area minimums for the districts in which they're located enjoy the benefits of dry, safe storage that a garage provides. Indeed, 11 Buckingham has had that practical storage for 89 years and the Owners are simply asking that this unusually narrow but area-endowed lot be deemed sufficient to continue to accomodate a small garage.","The proposed dormer at the south side of the second floor of the house meets the requirements of the Ordinance because it does not contribute to any non-conformity nor does it intensify neighborhood density. Because its construction is more than 50% a reconstruction of an original dormer that was removed in 1992, and because its dimensions fall below the City's recommended dormer size guidelines, it is architecturally appropriate to the building. The additional square footage gained in the building by construction of the dormer increases the FAR by only .006, and takes the total FAR from .328 to .333, well below the required maximum of .5 in the district.","No traffic is generated, no patterns of access are changed, and thus no congestion nor neighborhood hazard is caused by the construction of the dormer.",No continued use or future developed uses on adjacent properties will be adversely affected by building this proposed dormer.,"The existing second floor of the original house, prior to 1992, had a dormer in the location of the one proposed herein. It was removed in 1992 and the second floor wall of the house was moved further in to the second floor space in order to create a tall enough wall in which to install glass doors out to a rubber-roofed balcony. The construction had the affect of creating a ""bathtub"" that filled with water, leaked into the ceiling below, and damged the kitchen walls and structure. Replacement of the dormer and extending it to meet the sloped roof portion at the rear of the house will eliminate this problematic balcony, allowing the building to properly shed rain and snow again, and prevent further damage.","The proposed dormer is designed to the architecture of the origianl 1892 building, it is sized to both restore the building's original architecture and to conform to the City's dormer guidelines, and its windows would bring useful healthy southern sunlight into the house. It is proposed with full conviction that contrary to being detrimental in any way, it will benefit the integrity of the district and the solidity of the structure.",Cambridge,MA,01/29/2020

The proposal to convert an existing non-conforming carriage house into an accessory apartment is to allow them to age in place when their primary residence is too large for their needs. Although the proposed conversion meets the Special Permit requirements for an accessory apartment (Pursuant to article 4.22.1) the poor structural condition of existing carriage house with no foundation and its siting extremely close to the rear property line makes restoration of the carriage house impractical. Petitioners’ proposal to demolish and rebuild the accessory structure changes the requested relief from a Special Permit to a Variance although the structure will be in greater conformance with the zoning ordinance proving the required 5’ setback for accessory structures.A literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would make the request conversion (renovation and restoration) of the existing Carriage House impractical and cause a substantial hardship without the requested relief. The hardship is owing both to the poor structural condition of the carriage house and the siting of the carriage house on the lot.,"The proposed conversion will not be a detriment to the public good because the accessory structure will be moved further away from the rear property line, no windows are being proposed on the rear facade and the proposed conversion will restore an outdated accessory structure to residential use adding to Cambridge’s housing stock of renovated dwellings.",The relief requested is consistent with the intent and purpose of Ordinance which calls for the most rational use of land throughout the city (article 1.03). The proposed conversion restores an underutilized accessory structure in a manner that is compatible with the existing neighborhood character as opposed constructing a second freestanding dwelling which could be built on the lot due to its large lot size.,The Hardship is owing in part to the non-conforming positioning of the Carriage House on the lot and poor condition of the accessory structure. Without improving the rear yard setback construction would be severely constrained if not infeasible.,"No congestion, hazard, or substantial change in the established neighborhood character will result from the conversion of the preexisting non-confomring garage into an accessory apartment because proposed accessory apartment will largely be shielded from the public way, there are no proposed windows or openings facing the abutting rear neighbor and the proposed conversion will upgrade the dwelling with modern amenities and systems allowing for the owners to age in place.","The continued operation of or the development of adjacent uses will not be adversely affected because the proposed conversion to an accessory apartment is consistent with the residential character of the neighborhood and adjacent residential uses. Additionally, the Cambridge City Council in 2018 adopted an amendment to the Accessory Dwelling Provisions (article 4.22) specifically allowing for conversion of accessory structures by special permit consistent with relief requested in this application.","No nuisance or hazard will be created nor will any detriment to the health, safety and/or welfare of the occupants of the proposed use or the citizens of the City for the reasons stated previously and because the proposed use is consistent with the allowed residential uses in the district, the proposed density on the lot will be less than the district maximum and due to the size of the lot the Petitioner could construct a much larger free-standing single family that would have far greater impact to the neighborhood.",The proposed accessory apartment will not impair the integrity of the district and is consistent with the intent of the ordinance by allowing for the renovation and modernization of Cambridge’s accessory structure at a scale that is compatible with existing neighborhood character.,,Cambridge,MA,08/27/2020

A new window will also be added in the basement on the Northern side. Construction will also involve a new addition to the existing structure which will match the existing wood frame construction and white board paneling with matching glazing. The roof of the new addition will be accessible and have a wood deck with planters.,"A literal enforcement of Sections 5.31, 8.22.1(d) and 8.22.1(f) of the Zoning Ordinance would prevent the petitioner from reasonably enlarging the 2.5 story house at 5 Dana Street to include a den and mud room for the growing family. Although the nonconformities are minor they create a hardship in the development of a large enough addition to cater for the family's needs and allow for the design of an addition that suits the historical character of the house that has existed for decades.","The requested relief may be granted without any detriment to the public good because the proposed alternation and addition to the existing structure at 5 Dana Street involve a minor increase in the area of the structure and the dimensional violations for which the petition is seeking relief have existed for decades. Additionally, with the newly acquired lot area to the rear, the ratio of gross floor area to lot area is now less and consequently the ratio of usable open space has increased.","The requested relief will be consistent with the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance because it will allow for an addition that conforms to the character of the existing dwelling and surrouding neighborhood while also catering to the growing families needs. The addition still seeks to follow the minimum side yard setback and is limited to the rear, southwest corner which does not impact adjacent lots and neighbors.","The petitioner's hardship is owing primarily to the unique size, shape and location of the existing lot and building at 5 Dana Street, which make it impossible for the petitioner to comply with the side yard setback and increase in area of less than 10% while reasonably renovating and altering the existing structure to create a large enough addition which extends directly from it and follows from its facades.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,08/14/2014

The proposed dormer is needed to make the existing third floor lot into a habitable bedroom for the applicants, child, a six year-old who attends Morse School, and to accommodate a growing family. It is currently difficult to access the third floor, as the existing stairs to the third floor loft does not comply with curent building codes.

In turn these changes, as proposed, are to help the petitioners', new owners of the property, accommodate themselves to their new home.  Specifically, Margaret E. Gadon suffers from a a condition known as seasonal affective disorder and bringing more natural light into the master bedroom- by increasing the number of windows and specifically the proposed window seat bump-out will help reduce the disorder's occurrence and the changes proposed elsewhere in the home are also being pursued with this mind. Additionally, the variance will permit such changes to the home in a way to allow the petitioners' to enjoy the home with their visiting grown sons and their future families.The extension of the second floor dormer will reconfigure a small bedroom to allow for a full size bed.   The proposed third floor dormer, in addition to allowing natural light and ventilation, will allow the family a large indoor gathering space for entertainment.","The variance items listed are requested within the context of the building's new owners' undertaking at this time to initiate a major restoration & preservation of this approx. c. 1895 ""shingle style"" residence's entire exterior skin, along with pursuing a major energy efficiency upgrade to update all the building's mechanical systems and its thermal energy performance (insulation, windows, air-sealing, thermal break, roofing, etc. with all combined proposed upgrades contributing significantly to the ""public good"" by sensitively updating while preserving the character of this lovely example of one of Cambridge's historic styles of domestic architecture.The dormer addition proposed for the third floor is deemed an architecturally preferable  more appropriate way to get light and air onto the 3rd floor in lieu of skylight openiungs which are felt to be less of ""of the period"""" of the house's style, but would noit require variance approval for added GFA to install, as is the case with the more costly dormer addition being proposed.  This is believed to meet with both the intent & spirit of the zoning ordinance.","The petitioner would like to point out that the great majority of the area of the existing house that is currently above the total amount of FAR allowed by the ordinance, is simply a resultant of the fact that the existing house already possesses an unfinished basement which is very tall (7'-4""+ in clear ht.)  It is not the petitioners' intent to occupy/make habitable any unfinished spaces below grade,  as it's both dark and damp there, but is felt that the inclusion of this area into the FAR calculation as required does present a somewhat misleading impression as to the overall size of the current usable living area of this existing home when presented solely ""by the numbers"" with that included.","The existing unfinished basement, while it has a generous clear ceiling height available of 7'-4"" (thus included in FAR calc) is subject to occasional groundwater incursion, and so is not considered a suitable location to locate any finished living space.",n/a,n/a,n/a,"The north building face does not immediately closely abut/look into the neighboring house in any close proximity (see photo provided of ""Left Side Elevation"" existing condition).   Petitioner believes no detrimental intrusion into neighboring privacy will be effected by this change/window add, especially as the proposed opening is intended to allow daylighting into a second floor secondary bathroom, where the new opening will also have window treatment of curtains or shades intalled there for visual privacy inside the bath.Additionally, current exterior conditions indicate that this house previously/historically had a window in this same location, (see discolored siding patch in photo provided labelled ""window for special permit"" for reference) and the intent of this application is to have permission to restore that doublehung window to match both its former size and location in the north wall of the building.",n/a,Cambridge,MA,08/14/2014

In addition, 74 Oxford and many of the other building buildings are eligible for review by the Historic Commission further limiting allowable alteration allowing the structure  to adapt to changing needs.

The relief requested allows the continuation of the existing use in a compliant manner.","Hardship is owing to the size, shape and age of the existing Structure.  The cost of restoration, the demolition and/or reuse of outdated structural and fire-preventative construction methods, the limitations placed by both Historic Conformity and Zoning Non-Conformity combine to render the economic adaptation and reuse of the building unlikely at 74 Oxford Street.

The enlarged rear portion of the structure will allow for an enlarged kitchen and half bathroom on the first floor, a second full bathroom on and code compliant master bedroom on the second floor. Two 15-feet wide dormers will be erected on the attic level to allow for code compliant stairs up to an attic storage area.  Basement of the structure is plagued by water infiltration and mold issues rendering it unusable for storage.  Due to the pre-existing interior configuration of rooms and historic structure (limiting options for modifications to the front portion of the home), there are no better alternatives to achieve the needed additional space for this growing family.  Additionally, the pre-existing narrow (40 feet wide), undersized lot and location of the structure on the far left side of the lot, any additions to the structure will require a variance.  A literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the petitioners from making desirable improvements to the interior and modest expansion to the home.","The relief from Sections 5.31 and 8.22.2(c) may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because it would be a very minimal change – the newly reconstructed rear el will be located within the existing footprint of where the rear porch exists today, and will be mostly unseen by the public.  The attic level 15 feet wide dormers will not be detrimental to neighboring uses, as the left side dormer will be above the stairwell to the attic (thus not posing privacy issues for its neighbor), and the right side dormer will be set back from the right side lot line by more than 17 feet, and thus not within side yard setbacks. There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioners to proceed with plans to make much needed improvements to allow for their family to comfortably remain in their home with growing children, and such improvements will result in housing stock that will be suitable to future residents with families.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the interior layout of the structure, historic nature of the main portion of the home, the siting of the structure on the narrow lot, and the structure’s location very close to the left side of the lot.  Additionally, the hardship relating to the need for attic level storage is due to ground water infiltration issues in the basement which may be difficult or impossible for the homeowner’s to remedy.  These unique circumstances result in Petitioner requiring variance relief.","The proposed renovation includes relocated and new windows on the left side of the house.  These window alterations and additions will occur within the pre-existing nonconforming side setback, and are necessary to accommodate interior room changes on the lower levels, and to allow for light and air ventilation on the attic level of the home, and require special permit relief in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character, but will vastly improve the conditions within the home.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed remodeling of the house, and adjacent uses will not be adversely affected by the requested special permit relief.","No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the window improvements should have very limited impact on abutters due to the locations of these windows offset from the neighbor’s windows and largely screened from its neighbor by foliage.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the altered window locations and new windows will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.",Boston,MA,02/14/2019

Exterior dimensions are 29'x37' with the addition of a 2 story porch (7.1' x18.8'),"165-167 Putnam Ave. was constructed in 1905 prior to the introduction of modern weatherproofing and insulation techniques. Due to a lack of insulation the home requires great expense to heat and cool. In addition pipes routinely freeze due to drafts and gaps in the insulation in exterior walls necessitating costly repairs to the plumbing and repairing water damage. The owners are unable to further insulate the interior cavity of the walls due to a prior owners installation of cellulose fiber. The cellulose installation left many gaps and partially filled stud cavities. Further the cellulose does not contain a moisture barrier. Re-insulating the stud cavities with fiberglass or spray foam insulation would require excavating the existing cellulose. Removing the cellulose would require removing the entire exterior sheathing or removing plaster from interior walls, which would be an exorbitant expense and a hardship for the owners. Exterior insulation is currently the most cost effective way to increase the R value of the walls and improve the heating and cooling efficiency of the building.","The addition of 1"" of rigid foam to the exterior of the building will be virtually unnoticeable under the fiber cement boardsiding. Without measuring tools the minor change to the exterior of the building will be undetectable to neighbors andpassers by. The overall apearance of the home will be improved by the installation of new cement board siding and PVC trim boards. The owners are serving the public good by increasing the energy efficiency of their home. This will directly reduce the green house emissions and carbon footprint of the home. While small in overall effect this effort also improves air quality by reducing the exhaust fumes generated by heating equipment. The additional insulation will help bring the home closer to meeting the energy efficiency standards mandated by current ordinances and building codes.","Current overhangs and eves extend beyond the additional thickness of the exterior wall. These eves and overhangs will not be altered. Further 165-167 Putnam has ample open space and more than adequate set backs on 2 of the 4 sides. Ordinance 22.34.2 was written with the intent to allow exterior insulation, while setting a limit (4"") on the thickness of the insulation. The specification of a 7'2"" set back is contrary to the language supporting building with pre-exisiting nonconforming setbacks. The additional thickness of the wall will not encroach on any public or private right of way or reduce the distance to neighboring structures.","Ordinance 22.34.2 contains a set back requirement which assumes that the building was constructed with a set back conforming to the current building ordinance. 165-167 Putnam Ave. was constructed in 1905 prior to the current set back requirements, and is a pre-existing non conforming condition. The age of the property and the conforming conditions at the time of construction should be considered.Ordinance 22.34.2 Allows for existing conforming or pre-existing non conforming buildings or building that received a building permit before August 2, 2010 to encroach upon the set back or to encroach further upon the set back up to 4 inches in order to add exterior insulation. The current required set back in zone C-1 is 7'6"" Ordinance 22.34.2 establishes the minimum set back at 7'2"" (7'6""-4"" = 7'2""). Many homes in Cambridge pre-date the current set back ordinances and are non conforming. In C-1 the majority of the homes have non-conforming setbacks, many of which have less set back than 165-167 Putnam Ave.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,03/06/2019

Proposed new construction will use the same material palette as the existing construction.,"The provisions of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance were created long after the existing structure was built rendering it non-conforming in multiple ways.  Many of the existing structures in the area are non-conforming with respect either F.A.R. or Lot Area per Dwelling Unit or both.  In addition, 74 Oxford and many of the other building buildings are eligible for review by the Historic Commission further limiting alterations that enable the structure  to adapt to changing needs. A literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would make the desirable renovation and restoration of the existing structure infeasible.","74 Oxford has operated for years as Multi-Family Housing with 9 units, and 3 parking spaces.  The proposed changes will bring the use and parking in greater conformance with the provisions of the Zoning Code.  The reduction in the number of units is more in keeping with the neighborhood housing stock.",The relief requested adds a modest amount of above grade gross floor area which is in keeping with the FAR of many of the adjacent properties.  The lot coverage remains consistent with the adjacent properties in the neighborhood.  The changes do not increase the building height and do not create any new setback violations.  The number of Dwelling Units and Parking Spaces proposed will cure current non-conformities.,"Hardship is owing to the size, shape and age of the existing Structure.  The cost of restoration, the demolition and/or reuse of outdated structural and fire-preventative construction methods, the limitations placed by both Historic Conformity and Zoning Non-Conformity combine to render the economic adaptation and reuse of the building unlikely at 74 Oxford Street.  These difficulties do not exist on an empty lot where the Ordinance can be applied in a practical, versatile way.","Article 6 provides for relief from the required parking quantities in Section 5.35.  The proposed project will not cause excessive congestion, endanger public safety or reduce the availability of parking in the area.  Article 8 provides relief for new dormers and new openings to encourage the renovation and reuse of existing buildings.",The proposed development will not create a congestion hazard or substantial change given that the driveway and curb cut will remain in their current location.  The traffic generated by the proposed use will be reduced compared to the current use.  The proposed use is consistent with existing uses in the neighborhood.,The driveway curb cuts will remain as they exist allowing traffic patterns to remain the same.

Also, staff parking is not necessary because the majority of the Daycare Facility's staff lives locally and will be walking to work.","The primary users of the Daycare Facility will be parents who are picking up and/or dropping off their children. The people who will be using the Daycare Facility live in the general area of the Premises. As a result, any effect on traffic will be limited to people coming and going from Petitioner's off-street parking and curb-side drop-offs. Allowing Petitioner to operate the Daycare Facility with two (2) off-street parking spaces will have no negative impact on the general public or abutters and will not change the neighborhood's character.","Petitioner is not aware of any other daycare centers in the immediate vicinity of the Premises, so there will be no competitive impact. The Premises are located in an area on Cambridge Street that is populated with commercial establishments and surrounded by commercial zones (i.e. C-1, C-2, C-3). The traffic flow to be generated by the Daycare Facility will be temporary during pickup and drop off times and will be de minimis in comparison to that generated by the surrounding businesses and commercial zones. Allowing Petitioner to operate the Daycare Facility with two (2) off-street parking spaces will have no negative impact on the general public or abutters.",The Daycare Facility is a permitted use in a Business - A zone. Petitioner's lawful operation of the same will not create a nuisance. All activities to occur at the Daycare Facility will be contained to the interior of the Premises. Allowing Petitioner to operate the Daycare Facility with two (2) off-street parking spaces will have no negative impact on the general public or abutters.,The Daycare Facility is a business that involves caring for children over an extended period of time (i.e. several hours). The Daycare Facility is a permitted use in a Business - A zone. The Daycare Facility will serve the community's interest of having safe and reliable childcare options close to residential areas. Allowing Petitioner to operate the Daycare Facility with two (2) off-street parking spaces will have no negative impact on the general public or abutters.,Boston,MA,03/27/2019

Petitioner’s proposed design for the new residential units was granted a Certificate of Appropriateness by the Mid-Cambridge Historic Commission after a process of public hearings and redesign to address public and Historic District Commission concerns.  The new construction meets nearly all of the dimensional and other requirements of the zoning ordinance, with the exception of a few requirements for which the Petitioner is seeking zoning relief.  A literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, requiring the Petitioner to go “back to the drawing board” for a complete redesign and reevaluation by the Mid-Cambridge Historic Commission.  The zoning and historic considerations may be irreconcilable.  Literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would require the Petitioner to widen the back portion of the driveway (off Cambridge Street) to meet the Zoning Ordinance requirement for a 10 ft. wide driveway (see Article 6, Section 6.43.4). Under the current proposal the driveway is 10.3 ft. at the front of the lot (off Cambridge St.) and then tapers back (0.7 ft.) to a width of 9.3 ft. at the back of the parking area.  If the Petitioner is required to provide the additional width to the driveway, she will lose critical width of the front building (Building #1) containing two side by side units; a narrowed building width would render this side unit unworkable or undesirable for future owners.Petitioner also seeks relief from Article 5, Section 5.3 Dimensional Standards as they may apply to the calculation of (a) the distance between the buildings on the lot, and (b) the front and side yard setbacks.  While the Petitioner believes that its interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance results in the proposal complying with the Dimensional Standards on both of these issues, the Petitioner raises these potential issues to the Board, and asks that the Board either determine that the proposal complies with the Dimensional Standards, or if not, that the Board find that the Petitioner is otherwise entitled to a variance due to the hardship that would result from an enforcement of the Ordinance.(a)	Unenclosed porches and stairs between the buildings:The shortest distance measured between the exterior foundation walls of the buildings is 10.2 ft; this is greater than the minimum required distance of 10.0 ft. and complies with the Ordinance.  See the architect’s floor plans (p.___) for detailed calculations.  The unenclosed porches and stairs located at the rear of Building #1 in the space between the buildings meet the requirements described in Article 5, Section 5.24.1 as follows: “unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above the average level of the adjoining ground”, which according to this Section 5.24.1 “may extend beyond the minimum yard regulations otherwise provided for the district in which the structure is built.”  Thus, it is the Petitioner’s understanding that the rear unenclosed porches and stairs located between the buildings are allowed to extend into the yard area between the buildings, notwithstanding the Ordinance requirements with respect to yard area between buildings.  In the event that this Board should disagree with this interpretation, the Petitioner asks the Board to grant it relief from this requirement of the Ordinance for the reasons described herein.  If required to move the egress porches and stairs, the only workable solution would be to move them to the front of the building along Cambridge Street, which would result in negative impacts to the neighborhood and historic viewscape, and would result in a far less desirable design from the perspective of those who live in the units.(b)	Window wells/retaining walls between the buildings and within front and side yard setbacks:The residential units include living space in the basement, with window wells (to provide adequate light and emergency access to these spaces) with low retaining walls.  There are two window well/retaining walls at the rear of Building #1.  There are three window well/retaining walls at the front of the buildings (respectively on Cambridge St. and Highland St.) and on the right side of Building #2.  The Dimensional Standards regulate distance between “buildings” on a lot.  Similarly, front and side yards are defined on the basis of the distance between the front or side (as applicable) line of the lot and “the nearest part of a building”.  A Building is defined as “[a]ny structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure of persons, animals, chattels, or property of any kind”.  A window well with low retaining wall does not meet this definition, and thus should not be considered part of the building for purposes of calculating the distance between the buildings or the front or side yard setbacks.   In the event that this Board should disagree with this interpretation, the Petitioner asks the Board to grant it relief as necessary from the Dimensional Standards as they relate to the distance between the buildings and the front and side yard setback requirements of the Ordinance for the reasons described herein.  The creation of exempt, basement livable space is permitted as of right in single- and two-family structures pursuant to the recent Ordinance amendment.  Allowing for adequate light, air and egress to these areas of the building are beneficial to those who reside in these spaces, and are not as a matter of zoning law detrimental to the abutters or others within the District.  As such, there is no basis in Zoning law to create a different interpretation of the Ordinance in such a way as to disallow the creation of such window wells with low retaining walls.  It should be noted that the depth of the window wells was taken into account when the architect calculated the height of the new buildings above average grade; the buildings’ heights continue to comply with the maximum height for the District notwithstanding the variable grade at the foundation of the buildings.","The relief from Section 6.43.4 with respect to driveway width may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because it would simply be a continuation (however, with significant improvements) to the existing conditions on the lot.  The abutter to the driveway currently looks out on a wide aged driveway strewn with debris and broken-down garage/shed at the rear.  The new project would include new high-quality fencing, reduced paving, landscaping and a residential use that is consistent with uses in the neighborhood.  The driveway width will be compliant at the opening where vehicles exit the driveway, where visibility and safety for pedestrians are concerned.  In the event, and to the extent, that the Board believes that the proposed construction does not comply with Section 5.31 with respect to the distance between buildings on the lot, the proposed rear unenclosed porches and stairs and window wells located within the two buildings will have no impact on the public, the neighborhood or the District.  Owners and residents of these buildings will have reviewed plans and, if a condominium form of ownership, condominium association documents, and thereby will have approved of the configuration of the buildings, landscaping and circumstances.  Porches and stairs in this location will be largely obscured from the public’s view, certainly more so than if the Board were to deny this relief, resulting in a redesign that would put these porches and stairs at the front of Building #1 along Cambridge Street.  In the event, and to the extent, that the Board believes that the proposed construction does not comply with Section 5.31 due to window wells with low retaining walls being located within front and side yard setbacks, these conditions will not be detrimental to the public good.  Basement livable space is permitted as of right, and desirable in single- and two-family structures consistent with the recent amendment to the Ordinance.  Adequate light, air and egress from these exempt living spaces is also desirable for those living in these buildings, and will, in this case, have very little impact on neighboring properties.  The project is bordered by Cambridge Hospital (across Cambridge Street), a large apartment building (across Highland Street) and a neighboring boarding house (next door on Highland Street), both with very limited views of this lot and the proposed window wells with retaining walls.    There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  The design results in housing stock that will be suitable to residents with families, creating desirable, quality housing stock.  Furthermore, the relief is necessary in order to allow for a design that is considered preferable and consistent with the historic nature of this location, as approved by the Mid-Cambridge Historic District Commission.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Improve the value of surrounding residential homes in the neighborhood.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.•	Create a residential project that meets approval of the Mid-Cambridge Historic District Commission.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the size and shape of the corner lot as it is situated along the Mid-Cambridge Historic District, and the resulting constraints on the design of the project in keeping with neighborhood and Mid-Cambridge Historic District Commission concerns.  The Commission met with the Petitioner over three hearings, and recommended the current design which was considered historically appropriate and in fitting with the neighborhood.  Benefits include the placement of three units within two structures (avoiding one large three-family structure which might have been built as of right, but would have resulted in an inferior project for historic and aesthetic reasons), and the angled clean façade of the building along Cambridge Street. Additionally, the current location of curb cuts and paved driving areas are unique factors affecting this Property, and lead the Petitioner to seek relief so as to avoid a costly and disruptive process for demolition and reconstruction of the curb cuts, driveways and parking areas on the lot.","Petitioner will not be able to meet the dimensional requirements set forth in Article 6, Section 6.43.5 (a) and (b) as it relates to the location of parking spaces on the lot.  The two (2) parking spaces in the driveway off of Highland Street will be located in the same location as they exist currently, which are side-by-side, with less than the required five (5) feet setback from the side lot line.  Thus, there will be no change and therefore no negative impact to the abutter on Highland Street.  The one (1) parking space in the driveway off of Cambridge Street will also be located near the lot line and less than the required five (5) feet setback from the side lot line.  The parking location will be only slightly closer to the lot line than exists currently.  However, due to the fact that there is now a high fence between these properties, and there will be a replaced, higher qualify fence and other landscaping improvements on the lot, the abutter on Cambridge should experience a much improved situation in terms of views and privacy.","The proposed parking situation will be substantially the same as the current parking on the lot, and will be improved with new fencing (on Cambridge Street side) and landscaping and attractive, high-quality residential housing on the lot.  There will be no resulting additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character on account of the proposed parking, which will be consistent with parking situations throughout the neighborhood and the District.","Adjacent uses will not be adversely affected by the requested special permit relief for parking within the five (5) feet setbacks, as these conditions exist (and with a more intensive commercial/retail use) currently with the existing retail store use.","No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as these similar parking conditions exist today, however with arguably a more intensive and/or inconsistent use by the existing commercial/retail users.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because it will essentially be a continuation of an existing situation, albeit with a less intensive and intrusive residential parking.",Boston,MA,11/08/2019

We also intend to apply for a curb cut permit, whose ordinance requirements are met through our plan.","The granting of the special permit, and eventually the curb cut permit, will allow for parking spaces on our own properties and off the street, thus improving the availability of street parking. Our proposal would remove more cars from the street than could park in the length of the curb cut, thus easing congestion. Moreover, we have already spoken with our abuttors, and all we have heard from have provided their approval (see attachment). Lastly, almost all homes on Magoun Street have a curb cut and off-street parking; as such the neighborhood character would not change (see attachment with images).","Creation of the parking from the driveway and the curb cut will not adversely affect the adjacent residential uses. In fact, we as applicants are each the adjacent neighbor that would be most impacted, and we are seeking to create this driveway together for each of our mutual benefits. Properties behind will not be affected as the driveway will not go into the backyard. Neighbors have provided approval for the project.","The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41/43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times. We at 45 Magoun Street are seniors and would like easier access to our cars. Paul is deaf in one ear and has only 40% hearing in the other, making it difficult to hear the fast oncoming traffic when entering the car. In addition, our parked car on the street was recently banged on the side by someone driving down the street. It was extremely stressful to deal with the aftermath and resistance from the insurance company. The parking space will also enable better public health and clean air, as it will open up the opportunity for electric cars and less emissions. We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally.","Curb cuts, off-street driveways, and even mutual driveways are common in North Cambridge.

Operation of a Fast Food Order Establishment is permitted in a Business B district by special permit.  The proposed use simply continues the business operations conducted substantially without change at the location since 2003.  The ""bubble tea"" restaurant (d/b/a ""Boston Tea Stop"") serves teas, mochi ice creams and a few other confections. (Bubble tea, also known as pearl milk tea or boba milk tea, is a popular tea-based drink incorporating chewy tapioca balls added to the drink. Mochi ice cream is a confection made from mochi -- pounded sticky rice -- with an ice cream filling.)  Providing these items to students, residents, shoppers and tourists at this location serves the needs of the public without adverse impact of any nature.  The business is exclusively a walk-in operation:  customers essentially never arrive by car.  Therefore there are no traffic impacts of any sort.  Likewise, the business does not appreciably add to the pedestrian traffic along JFK Street, a busy pedestrian district.Under the Zoning Ordinance, Section 11.30, in considering this application, the BZA also needs to find that the requested special permit will meet the following additional requirements (which Applicant respectfully submits are met for the reasons stated below):(a) since the customers of the business come exclusively on foot, and not by car, the operation of the establishment will not:     (1) create traffic problems,      (2) reduce available parking,     (3) threaten the public safety in the streets and sidewalks, or     (4) encourage or produce double parking on the adjacent public street(s),(b) since no changes to the business are proposed -- a business that has operated without complaint of problem in this location since 2003 -- the physical design, including color and use of materials, of the establishment will be compatible with and sensitive to the visual and physical characteristics of other buildings, public spaces and uses in the particular location;(c) as demonstrated by the success of this business at this location, the establishment fulfills a need for such a service in the neighborhood or in the city;(d) as stated above, the establishment will attract patrons primarily from walk in trade as opposed to drive in or automobile related trade;(e) as it has over the past 11 years, the establishment will continue, to the greatest extent feasible, to utilize biodegradable materials in packaging the food and in the utensils and other items provided for consumption thereof;(f) as it has over the past 11 years, the establishment will continue to provide convenient, suitable and well marked waste receptacles to encourage patrons properly to dispose of all packaging materials, utensils and other items provided with the sale of food; and(g) the establishment complies with all state and local requirements applicable to ingress, egress, and use of all facilities on the premises for handicapped and disabled persons.","As mentioned above, the business causes no additional traffic, because its customers come and go on foot.  And, as mentioned, the business is a small operation, and will not materially add to the pedestrian traffic in the neighborhood.  There are many other similar fast food operations nearby, including:  *  Dado Tea (50 Church)  *  TeaLuxe (0 Brattle)  *  Starbucks (36 JFK St., 31 Church, 1380 Mass. Ave.)  *  Tasty Burger (40 JFK St.)  *  Crazy Dough's Pizza (35 JFK St.)  *  Otto's Pizza (1432 Mass. Ave.)and many others (J.P. Licks, Boloco, B. Good to name just a few more).  Without question, there is a need for fast food order establishments providing food and drink.  Through its many years of operation, ""Boston Tea Stop"" has demonstrated that it will neither cause (further) congestion in its neighborhood (Harvard Square) or cause any change in the established neighborhood character.",Please see the responses above.,Please see the responses above.,"There is no other reason that the continuation of this fast food operation at this location -- substantially as conducted there for more than a decade, would impair the integrity of the district or otherwise derogate from the intent or purpose of the Zoning Ordinance.",Cambridge,MA,10/06/2014

Regarding the 812 Lobby, adding the mandatory new fire command center within the existing lobby footprint would make the lobby cramped and less accessible to building residents, which would be severely detrimental to their enjoyment of the property.","We cannot think of what substantial detriment to the public good would result from the proposed recladding or lobby expansion. Conversely, the granted relief would increase residents' enjoyment of the property, improve the property's energy efficiency, reducing operating costs and carbon footprint, and upgrade the aesthetics for the larger community.","We believe the relief would allow us to better meet intentions of the Ordinances, which seeks to improve the well-being of residents and the energy efficiency of a building in a substantial rehab without negatively impacting abutters or the general public at large. Our proposed scope would accomplish this goal if granted the requested relief, and would fall short of these goals if such relief were denied.","The scale of the building, as well as its original construction technique, is what makes the proposed recladding outboarding necessary. Four inches of setback encroachment may be appropriate for retrofitting a single family house, but a 300 unit high-rise property requires more room to accomodate the necessary materials, as well as the internal support structure. Similarly, the hardship for the expanded lobby footprint stems from the Cambridge Fire Department's fire command center requirements as part of a substantial rehabilitation for a property of such a scale.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Cambridge,MA,05/31/2019

Our initial plan for a storage loft which leaves half the area of the building open from first floor to roof does not make architectural sense given the interior floor area of just 192 sq.ft. Increasing the loft to a full floor - by adding 96 sq. ft. floor space - will provide a far more appropriate utility and working space for our growing art and design business.The cost of construction is considerably less for a full second floor as opposed to the half loft second floor, because with the loft construction we would need to use balloon framing with full-height doubled studs 12"" on center. With a full second floor we can take advantage of the integrated floor joists to strengthen the framing and thereby use single studs spaced 16"" on center. The reduction of wood framing in the full-floor version gives more area for insulation and improved energy- and sound-efficiency.Our structural engineer determined that balloon framed walls will require very long lengths of dimensional lumber and the use of Versa-Lam columns, all of which are more expensive and far more unwieldy than more commonly-available framing materials which we would use in the case of a full second floor constructiuon.",Proposed addition of space is only interior and does not impact anyone except the homeowners.

This is for a signage variance.,"TEMPO, being a newly constructed community, has recently obtained a TCO for Building 201 and is currently on track to receive a TCO for building 203 in early September. As a requirement of our final Certificate of Occupancy, the Cambridge Fire Department had requested that we install building address numbers as high on the building as possible so that the site is easily identified by emergency vehicles needing to located the site. This relief is being requested in order to comply with the Fire Departments request and the signage is required to receive our CO.","The increased height and size of the building address and ID signage will not cause detriment to the public good due to the site’s location along Route 2 (Concord TPKE). Larger numbers and lettering will allow drivers to identify the site from a farther distance, lowering the number of drivers who might turn their head as they pass the property, looking for an at-grade monument sign or street address.No signs will extend more than 5” from the building façade. And no sign, classified as a projecting sign, will or be located above public or private walkways and driveways.","In addition to keeping up with local aesthetics, ordinances are often passed in response to a public safety issue. It is understood that size and location of signage can play a role in keeping pedestrians, drivers and residents safe. In this specific case, installing the building numbers and ID signage at an increased height would have greater visibility from a farther distance. This allows allow emergency vehicles,  as well as visitors, to easily identify the buildings, and provide ample time to prepare to enter the property at a fair speed, as drivers on Route 2 can often speed when approaching the Alewife Station exit.The ‘TEMPO’ lettering, although technically considered a projecting sign due to its location on a vertical canopy, is not located above any public/private driveway or walkway, and appears more as a wall sign than a projecting sign, therefore not nullifying or derogating the intent of the ordinance.","The TEMPO community is located on the eastbound side of Route 2 (Concord TPKE). The stretch of road in front of the property has three eastbound lanes and two westbound lanes. In between the eastbound and westbound lanes is a screened fence. The fence prevents westbound drivers, and potential site visitors, from seeing any signage located below the second-floor sill; the limit set force in chapter 7 of the city ordinance. Placing the building address and main ID signage at a height set forth in the ordinance will prevent drivers, and, potentially, emergency vehicles, from quickly identifying the buildings from a fair and safe distance.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,Waltham,MA,09/11/2020

Issued 6-11-2014,"The Cambridge Historical Commission is very intersted in preserviing this historic house. It was constructed in 1864 and moved from its original location on Linnean Street to its current location on Grant Street in 1865. It was first built for William Carter, who was gardener of the botanical gardens. Unfortunately for the house, Grant Street was raised around 1890, which buried the originally exposed brick foundation. Since the house has consequently been sitting virtually on ground level for the ensuing 125 years, moisture has penetrated the lower wooden structure and been followed by ants and pests that have thoroughly deteriorated the superstrucutre and disintegraed the original (now buried) brick. The proposed project consists of installing a new basement and foundation, restoring the house to its original height out of the ground (about 24"" of brick will once again be thereby exposed.) At the same time as this change restores and protects the house, the applicant seeks to derive some value from the basement by making it a habitable in what is otherwise only a 1240 square foot house. Although the house has a height of 21.5' and a proposed height of 23.5' (thus easily compliant for a height in a C-1 zone that allows 35'), the house is currently nonconforming for its left side setback so that raising the house requires a variance. The new habitable square footage (and volume) in the basement also requires a variance.Raising the house and deriving value from the basement created are essential elements of the plan to save and restore the house and a literal enforcement of the provisions of theb Oridinance would prevent it.","The relief sought raises the house 24"" but otherwise leaves the structure consistent with its historical use as a single family home without detriment to the public good. Further, the city is enhanced by presrvation of the historic house.",The relief requested does not change the general mass and scale of the house and is consistent with the purpose of preservation of the historic character of the city embodied in the ordinance.,The circumstance that the house was relcoated and foundation constructed prior to the raising of the street in the late 19th century has had the consequence that the associated import of soils have caused deterioriation of the house. This circumstance is specific to this historic house and the raising of the street.,,,,,,Winchester,MA,10/21/2014

The construction materials and techniques used were and are generally substandard throughout. For example, the rear addition, built in 1917, was constructed with no foundation and the addition sits on the ground. In 1920, it appears that the house was lifted, a commercial first floor was added, and the rear addition was expanded. The natural consequences of this poor-quality construction are structural instability and invitation to pests and vermin that affect not only this property but neighboring properties as well. In order to rehabilitate the existing building a new foundation must be constructed for the full footprint of the building. Once the foundation is completed the entire structure of the building needs to be replaced in order to make the property structurally sound and code-compliant. Given that the building is built from lot-line-to-lot-line there is no capacity for doing the significant rehabilitation necessary at the site in an incremental fashion. The only renovation method that makes sense both structurally and esthetically requires that the building be removed and replaced with a new structure. A literal enforcement of the Ordinance makes this impossible. The petitioner’s proposal is to reconstruct the building and substantially maintain the exterior appearance of the building while improving and revising the interior layout of the building in order to accommodate 21st century needs and code requirements. Again, the literal enforcement of the Ordinance makes this impossible.","The reconstruction of this building will create no detriment to the public good.

The hardship created by the relationship of the structure to the lot (lot-line-to-lot-line construction) together with soil conditions that negatively impact the present foundation (or no foundation at all) affects this lot only and is not a neighborhood-wide or zoning district issue.,"The Ordinance is designed to regulate changes to existing buildings or uses and the construction of new buildings or uses.  Here, the requested changes are designed to allow for the general replication of the original structure without creating any added burdens to the neighborhood or to the abutters.  The new building will improve the aesthetics and physical conditions of the site, making it safer and better constructed thereby improving the neighborhood in general without introducing any new burdens to the neighborhood.",Same as above.

It will not affect the privacy of residential neighbors and will cover an area already occupied by a deck. The canopy makes a negligible change to the FAR.,"The lot contains a structure built before the advent of zoning, which is grossly nonconforming to current standards and creates an unusual position for the building of a building on the lot.  The relocation ofthe window requires a variance because of insufficient set back from the lot line.  The current rear door opens to the exterior and is the occupant's second means of egress.  It currently exists without coverage, creating a hazardous condition for the occupants.","The current position of the window is nonconforming to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, Article 5, Section 31 due to insufficient setback from the lot line.  Relocating the kitchen window and replacing it with a smaller window in a different location lessens existing non-conformance to current standards","The location of the window is in the back corner of the lot.

The Petitioner is an established Cambridge resident who has lived at 11 Lopez Street since 1992.  He wishes to continue living at this location, but in a more spacious, functional, and energy-efficient home.  Modifications are necessary to expand living/sleeping space to allow Petitioner’s elderly mother to take up permanent residence (in this high walk-score location), to accommodate occasional visiting family members, maintain his home office, and improving conditions and access to the basement apartment. Additionally, the existing house (built 1905), which is pre-existing and legally non-conforming to the current dimensional requirements, requires extensive improvements, including the installation of new energy-efficient windows, roofing, siding, and insulation (currently almost non-existent); this is the case whether the house is enlarged or not.  The required improvements represent a significant portion of the total project cost, and will not be financially feasible to undertake unless the Petitioner is able to also expand the home and make necessary improvements to the basement apartment.","a.	The requested relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good, because the additions and other modifications will be in keeping with similar construction and improvements to older homes that has occurred in this neighborhood and along this street. b.	The proposed addition / alteration represents substantial redesign of an originally proposed addition that the Petitioner shared with neighbors over a year ago; it takes into account specific requests and suggestions of an abutter who had previously opposed the original design, but through a process of consultation and discussion has now indicated his support for the current revised proposed design.c.	The proposed addition and alterations will be aesthetically pleasing, reintroducing a level of architectural detailing which has been lost over the years, will be more energy efficient, and will fit well into a neighborhood of largely late 19th and early 20th century houses.d.	The improvements to the basement apartment will result in vastly improved living conditions for the tenants who reside here, and will result in the maintaining of much-needed rental housing.There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or parking on account of the relief requested herein.  It should be noted that the Petitioner’s elderly mother does not drive.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to vastly improve his property in order to allow for his family’s needs.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.Allowing the Petitioner's request for relief will also allow for a long-standing Cambridge resident to renovate and improve his home to be better suited to his family's needs, resulting in improved housing stock for City residents, while also preserving and improving the apartment unit at garden level for future rentals.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the aged structure, undersized in terms of its height, and sited on an undersized lot and in need of substantial and costly improvement and updating.

One entrance is on Cambridge Parkway, which runs between the building and the Charles River. This is a single-lane, one-way street with very little vehicular traffic. That which exists is slow-moving. The other main entrance, which has much greater visibility, faces Edwin Land Boulevard, a six-lane two-way high-traffic boulevard. Those looking for the 55 Cambridge Parkway building are at a disadvantage because the “55 Cambridge Parkway” entrance they might be looking for is facing “Edwin Land Boulevard”, and therefore a more visible sign on a clearly defined architectural background would be to their advantage in locating their destination.One solution to the lack of current visibility of the sign could be individual letters that are individually illuminated, providing better recognition at night. However, this produces two hardships. For the public, this would not help with daytime visibility. For the owner, the building façade exists with only one power source at that façade, an existing light fixture above the sign. Power would need to be pulled to additional locations for each individual letter, requiring significant added cost for electrical and masonry work.","Fast moving eastbound traffic on Memorial Drive is funneled onto Edwin Land Boulevard and drivers continue at the same speed as which they were already traveling. The posted speed limit on Memorial Drive is 35 mph but drivers routinely travel at speeds of approximately 45-50 mph in this location. Edwin Land Boulevard is three lanes in each direction with no breakdown lane. Cars are not able to quickly and readily identify the entrance to 55 Cambridge Parkway or react in time to pull into the parking garage. There is no breakdown or turning lane on either side of Edwin Land Boulevard and when drivers realize, often too late, where the entrance is, the safety of others is at risk as drivers brake hard to make the turn into the parking garage. We believe the best way to achieve the necessary heightened visibility is to place the address within an architectural background to break the connection that the letters have with the red brick façade, allowing for building identification from further distances. The improved sign is designed to minimize traffic confusion and allow for safe lane change to access the property.","At night, only the letters will be illuminated, which are within the 60 SF allowable size limit. The architectural background is opaque aluminum allowing it to visually disappear at night leaving the letters lit at 60 SF and meeting the intent of the bylaw.The entrance facing Edwin Land Boulevard has a courtyard surrounded by a two-storey brick wall with an arch that is approximately 23’-0” high, under which building visitors and occupants must pass when entering the building. The scale of this entrance is monumental, and the current signage feels out of scale on the expansive plane of red brick. By keeping the lettering the same size, within the 60 SF limit, but setting it off with an architectural background of opaque aluminum, we believe the entrance with its municipal message signage will appear better proportioned.This sign itself is a substantial investment by the building ownership and the process by which we are trying to obtain a variance is also a calculated investment. We have determined the pursuit of this signage variance to be a worthy one, and are invested in its success.","The color of the current signage (black with gold accent) blends into the existing red brick masonry façade. One small light is mounted above the signage to illuminate it at night, but this does not provide any help with daytime visibility. We propose keeping the letters within the 60 SF allowed by the sign ordinance of Cambridge, MA, while setting the letters off of the red brick façade with an architectural background of rectangular opaque aluminum material. This gives the letters a surrounding background which will provide added visibility during the daytime hours.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,Boston,MA,12/19/2014

There is substantial demand for inclusionary and market units at a smaller scale and price point. it is this demand that alleviates the substantial financial hardship of preserving and renovating existing building.","There is substantial demand for this smaller scale and less expensive housing in Central Square. It will relieve pressure on larger family units in the surrounding neighborhood. With the loss of many SRO and lodging accommodations in the Central Square Area, this is a much needed housing stock category. There is no esthetic, traffic, or quality of life impact and the overall FAR is within the new CSQ guidelines.  Permitting this Variance will create 4 additional Inclusionary units which are available at 25% of the applicant's income rather than the usual 30%. The new ordinance is creating far fewer smaller units (16% under old ordinance/12% under new ordinance) and this is a serious need that will only increase. Nearly 50% of the entire need in the City of Cambridge, based on existing inclusionary, is single person occupancy.","There will be no change to the proposed exterior of the buidling and this will allow the improvement of an obsolete structure in the middle of Central Square without displacing the local retailers. As the overall project is very low scale and a small urban infill, rather than the large scale residential development the ordinance is designed to address, this is an exception that is very specific to the challenges of this site that creates enough value to justify the enormous cost per foot, which has permitted most of this side of Mass Ave to fall into long term neglect.","The building is a very unusual shape having been developed over 100 years with additions. There is an easement for public emergency access that runs through the property alley which must be preserved, and the rear of the building may not be increased in height due to existing support structure of a different height to the floors. The area per floor is broken up by the requirement to add an elevator and emergency stair egress. This provides only very small spaces for units. The hardship in this particular location would be great for larger unit sizes.","All other requirements of the Ordinance are met. The variance addresses only the need for additional DU per lot area, due to the inclusion of small units.",There is no change to the access and egress and no additional parking or traffic impact anticipated. This is perfectly located above public transfortation and has been a failure as office and assembly space on the upper floors leading to deterioration. There is substantial demand in this area for smaller housing units and this number will have no detrimental effect on the overall traffic burden of the area.,There are numerous local retailers and especially restauranteurs who would only benefit by the addition of residential on this partion of Mass Ave.,"There is no impact on public safety, health or welfare. Units are served by public water and waste.",This is entirely in the spirit of the recent Zoning changes to the CSQ Overlay in encouraing reuse of obsolte and dilapidated structures and renovation of infill properties which would be too costly without the availability of variances and special permits.,Southborough,MA,

Further, in that both of these new small structures are similar to such vestibules and ""doghouse"" basement entries in the area and that neither one is noticeably closer to the property line than the existing unenclosed strutures (the existing stoop and the basement stairs), the neighborhood and the zoning intent will not be negatively affected.",,,,,,Arlington,MA,08/14/2019

The additionals FAR area relief requested is to allow "" reasonable arrangement and layout of the residential unit inside this existing structure""  ( quoted from article 5.28.21)Specifaclly, the proposed revised plans are intended to allow:1. Improved access into the upstairs unit by plan changes to fit an enlarged new stair to code.2. Improved access to daylight and southern exposure in primary living areas.3. Access to provate outdoor open space & rear garden by the proposed rework of the back porches with upstairs deck & stair.The program for the upstairs unit, as before, is for 2 bedrooms, with the seconf BR for fammily, visitors or a potential caregiver to be relocated onto the 3rd floor.Pertinent context information for this petition is that these owners sought, and were granted variance approval by the BZA back in 2004 for this property, to build a large third floor addition (with raised roof & 32' dormer lengths both sides) but were unable to proceed with constructions at that time due to unexpected changes in family circumstances.Thecurrent proposal to add a half story on 3, has been significantly downsized rom the scope of the 2004 variance approval, i.e to raise roof, and a construct a 15' long dormer on one side for necessary stair clearance.  Additional project planning constraints stem from the need to preserve as intact as possible the layout of the existing first floor unit (already fully renovated)  for budget reasons.","The modest increase in FAR/building bulk requested and the revised roof geometry proposed is believed to fit well within the scale of the neighborhood context of surrounding houses, and within the spirit of the recommended dormer guidelines.","The existing stair configuration and headroom limitations to access second floor in this particular instance is more constrained and difficult to negotiate than is usual in older homes, or than is acceptaable,  and requires additional space to redress while maintaing a 2 bedroom home.","The key component driving the layout changes proposed is to improve the stair situation.  The existing front stair currently presents a real hardship with its combination of steep and tight winders and extreme limitation of headroom clearance at the turn, such that no standard sized refrigerator or sizeable furnitureitems (or a stretcher in a medical emergency!) can fit upstairs.The existing back stair is so narrow,steep,winding and dark, as to be virtually unusable, if not dangerous to negotiate while carrying anything, such as a laundry basket.The revised plans seek to redress these deficiencies by framing out a generous new front stair, with proper headroom and without winders, and tuck an improved basement access stair below that.  Relocation of BR #2 to the 3rd floor allows room for a laundry on 2(avoiding trips to basement) and also allows some south facing windows to let direct sun/warmth into the primary living area.  The existing attic floor, while it exists, has the ridge framed too low (6'-11"" up to bottom of ridge framing) to create rooms of habitable dimension.",Attached,Attached,Attached,"The south building face ( see photo of ""right side elevation"") does not immediately/directly adjoin the the side of the neighboring house as they are separeted by both the width of the neighboring driveway and by an existing screening element of tall thin deciduous trees that have grown up along the south propertyline fence. Petioner believes no detrimental intrusion into neighboring privacy will be effected by this change.    The anount of the intrusion into the side setback zone as documented in the certified plot plan attached to this petition is only a matter of six inches (existing side setback is 7'-0"" rather than the the 7'-6' required by the zoning ordinance).The petitioners intention in reworking/adding windows on the south side is to allow more direct sun into their reconfigured living area at the second floor, which would be accomplished in large part through the top sashes of proposed doublehungs, while the bottom sashes could remain screened with a window treatment as needed to insure privacy is maintained between neighbors.",Attached,Cambridge,MA,02/26/2015

We’d like a parking spot where we can do so safely. This would additionally enable us to charge an electric vehicle and help reduce the carbon footprint in which our children grow up.Dormer: The stairs leading to our 3rd floor, as well as the landing at the top, do not have adequate headroom for safe egress in the event of an emergency and, in fact, it’s easy to hit one’s head in the course of normal use. Adding a dormer here would improve the safety and usability of this stairwell without substantively modifying the FAR or use of the house.Deck: Usable open space is critical to a child’s growth and development but our home, dating to 1849, has had its open space slowly eroded over 170 years. A significant contributor to this was the loss of a large deck above the former corner store, a deck whose railing was present in pictures dating to the turn of the century and was likely added earlier, when the store was built, to compensate for the loss of open space as a result of the store’s construction. We’d like to restore this railing and the usable open space it enables to allow our child additional room to thrive outdoors.","Parking spot: The parking space, while within a front yard setback, is nestled within the shape of the building and concealed by a fence. All abuttors have signed in support of the proposal, including Sacred Heart Parish and Donovan Aufiero Funeral Home, both of whom depend on street parking for their establishments and are well positioned to understand that the impact of a curb cut at this location will be limited. Given its proximity to an intersection, impact on available street parking will be minimal and usability and visibility of that intersection may be improved as cars will no longer park crowding the crosswalk.Dormer: The dormer will be positioned at the far rear of the property and will not be visible from the entrance of the house on Otis Street. While the dormer will be minimally visible from 6th Street, it’s in kind with other dormers in the area and even on the same block.Deck: Railing was historically present along the roof of the store and, just as we’re doing with the large shop windows we’re restoring to the store, restoring this railing will be in keeping with the building’s historic presence in the neighborhood. Additionally, given this deck’s location at the corner of an intersection and across from a large church, it’s far from abuttors and its use will have minimal impact.","Parking spot: The shape of our building provides a unique shelter from visibility for a parking space, satisfying the intent of the yard setbacks, while the use of permeable pavers for the parking spot will retain permeability. What open space may be lost by this addition is minimal compared to the safety it enables and may be offset by the addition of open space elsewhere, such as by the deck above the store, set forth in this proposal.Dormer: The sole purpose of the dormer is to increase the safety and usability of an existing stairwell and landing. It does not seek to expand use or greatly modify the exterior of the building.Deck: The historic presence of railing, coupled with the open space it adds that was clearly an offset for the loss of space at ground level when the store was constructed, make this a restoration both of the structure and of a private open space ratio in keeping with the neighborhood and the intent of the ordinance.",N/A,,,,,,Cambridge,MA,12/18/2019

Since that time, a reallocation of the interior square footage was made, so that the smaller front apartment was given a more appropriate bedroom space in the lower level of the building.  With the intention of adhering to the MA Building Code requirement that two means of egress within a structure be “remote as possible” (IRC, sect R311, w/MA Amendments) , the 2nd  means of egress for that front unit was changed to the lower level, which resulted in a new lower level walkout.It appears that since the building permit was granted, the interpretation of the zoning ordinance within the building department has changed to include a more restrictive interpretation of window wells and walkouts within a setback.  The original permit set included both walkouts and window wells, and the proposed requests a modification to those.  The main envelope of the house was, and still remains, conforming to all required setbacks, and is thus still an as-of-right structure.A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship, since the reconfiguration of the front unit would now be better and more safely served by a lower level egress from the lower level bedroom.  We believe that the new configuration makes for a more agreeable configuration on the left side of the building, and that the neighboring building to the left will benefit from this.",Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good because the residential use is consistent with the multifamily properties along Pearl Street.,"The requested relief will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because the requested relief will produce a residential unit that is in further compliance with the MA Building Code, and remove an upper level egress that is awkward.  Generally, the Zoning Ordinance, in Article 1.30 PURPOSE, defines its purpose, among many things, “to secure safety from fire…(and)…. to encourage housing”.  The modest modifications to the existing building permit are in line with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance.","The hardship is owing to the fact that the building is built on a narrow lot, with an existing driveway on the right side.  The Zoning ordinance now allows for habitable living spaces, including bedrooms, on the lower level.  Trying to achieve the best egress configuration for this building would suggest that the proposed lower level egress is a reasonable solution.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,10/23/2019

The only other building on the lot is a garage at the rear of the property.,A literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would prevent petitioner from being able to alter the overhang in any way leaving the door and neighboring window exposed.  Individuals waiting to enter from this doorway would not have adequate overhead coverage in the elements.,The altered overhang is not visible by a public way and stays within the existing footprint of the structure resulting in no effect to neighbors or those passing through the neighborhood.  The minor increase to the FAR does not result in any substantial or noticeable increase to the size of the building or the liveable space therein.,"The minor alteration does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance as it allows for a better quality use of the property without negatively affecting congestion, density, or blight in the neighborhood.  It is not an impermissible use of the premises and results in a benefit to the current and future owners.","The existing structure along with the unusual shape of the lot create a hardship for the petitioner which limits petitioner's ability to make any alterations to the proeprty without relief from the Ordinance.  The lot shape is unique to the property and is not generally an issue in the zoning district.  Further, because of the location of the pre-existing decks/porches on the structure, any change to the overhangs affects the FAR, which would prevent any ability by the petitioner to better protect windows and doorways by altering same.",,,,,,Somerville,MA,07/24/2019

The addition of an accessory unit would not impact adjacent homes in any way or change the character of the neighborhood.",The apartment would provide potential for a separate dwelling unit for a caregiver for the owners of the house.  The presence of a caregiver would only improve the health safety and welfare of the occupant and by separating the dwelling unit allowing for the opportunity to of privacy for both owner and occupant of the accessory unit.,"The addition of the basement apartment would better utilize the relatively large single family home as the stated as the intent of 4.22 in the Ordinance.

These include window & door relocations in the east end of the house occupying the rear yard and the addition of shed dormers at the third floor. The petitioner also seeks variances to add an entry canopy over the proposed relocated rear entry door. This modest addition requires relief from F.A.R. limits and from rear yard setback.,Variance:   To add an entry canopy over the proposed relocated rear entry door. Special Permit:  To install windows and doors in the setback and to build dormers in excess of a 10% increase in volume.,4099,4117,2322,4644,4644,5000,.882,.886,.50,2322,2322,2500,No change,140.4,50,No change,66.0,N/A,0.0,45.0,15.0,0.0,20.0,25.0,0.0,N/A,7.5,0.0,.30,7.5,37.2,10.5,N/A,62.0,6.0,N/A,36.0,3.0,N/A,.24,No change,.40,2,No change,2,3,No change,2,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,Dormers and inset balcony to be wood frame construction.* Proposed entry roof canopy to be pediment design 3 feet deep x 6 feet long with minimum offset to right side property line of .3 feet to be clad,A primary building entry/exit without a protective roof covering creates an ongoing hardship and potential safety hazard during inclement weather for all occupants and visitors but particularly for disabled family members. This rear door will be the only code-compliant common entry and exit for the building. The front door currently has an exterior canopy protecting it but inadequate landing space in front of the door at the top of the brick steps leading to it.,"The closest abutter to the proposed canopy is a public way (the new DCR bike path), not a residential neighbor. To the extent that yard setbacks are partly intended to ensure minimum fire separation distances between neighborhing buildings, the bike path lends considerable extra distance to the nearest structure to the east or south of the proposed canopy.","The modest ""floor area"" the proposed canopy requires is entirely exterior space, not enclosed habitable space. While it increases the F.A.R. by just .002 per cent, its impact on the neighborhood is negligible. Also, along with this canopy and new door location is the opportunity to remove approximately 18 square feet of brick steps currently serving the existing south side entrance. This yard area will be replaced with permeable materials.","The lot is both undersized and triangular in shape. Due to the unusual shape of the lot and the configuration of rooms within the house, the only reasonable and practicall location for a new code-compliant stair and grade level exit door is at the proposed location. Consequently, because this location falls within the non-conforming portion of the house with regard to setbacks, it is also not feasible for an exterior roof canopy to meet the full rear or side yard setback requirement.","While the proposed dormers increase headroom at the third floor, they do not increase the existing floor area ration (F.A.R.). Also, while previous additions increased the volume of the house to 21% over its original volume, the proposed dormers only bring this overage up to 22% and therfore the volume of the house will still be below the 25% maximum limit stated in Article 8.22.2 paragraph c. The dormers conform to all dimensional setback and height limtis of Article 5.0, and they have no impact on existing off-street parking. Finally, the deisgn of the dormers is in full compliance with published ZBA guidelines for dormers. The proposed changes to window and door openings within the non-conforming portion of the structure are necessary in order to accomodate a redesigned interior exit stair which will better serve both apartments and also the basement. The existing interior stair is extremely narrow and unsafe and has its narrow exit door onto the rear enclosed porch rather than directly to the exterior. Also, there is currently no code-compliant exit from the basement level which is used for residents' storage and mechanical equipment. Despite the fact that the new window and door openings are still within a non-conforming portion of the strucutre, they are nonetheless farther afield the property line than those that are being removed, and they significantly enhance life saftey via improved  building egress.","Neither the roof dormers, nor the window and door relocations pose substantial change to the neighborhood character, traffic generation. Building egress is improved for residents without negatively impacting neighborhood.","Neither the roof dormers nor the window and door relocations would affect the continued operation or  development of adjacent uses in any way, there being no change in proposed use.","Neither the roof dormers nor the window and door relocations would create a nuisance or hazard for anyone, there being no change in proposed use.",The roof dormers and the window and door relocations have been designed to integrate with other previously permitted work on the building and if approved will enhance the overall integrity of the structure.,Boston,MA,03/13/2020

Square footage information above shows information for the building (all three units) and the subject dwelling unit.,"A literal enforcement of the ordinance would prohibit the petitioner from making much needed and very modest alterations to a preexisting, nonconforming structure. Petitioners seek to renovate their home to prepare for their frail, elderly parents to stay with them while recuperating from medical conditions, and eventually to move in with them over the next few years.  A rear deck accessible to someone with mobility issues from the main living area is needed to allow access to the outdoors.  The installation of a new kitchen bay window will allow more light and area for an indoor plant area.","The rear deck is modest in size (4.3 x 10.6 ft), is located immediately next to the existing egress door, landing and stairs to the yard, and will be largely unseen by most neighbors. The new bay window is so modest in size, only 8 inches deep, and does not reach the floor plate.  As a bay structure, it is exempt from setback requirements. Although it may not even constitute new Floor Area under the Ordinance definition, it is included in this petition as a precautionary measure at the recommendation of the Building Commissioner.  There will be no detriment to the public on account of such minor changes to this dwelling unit, located at the far rear of this lot.","Allowing this variance will not nullify or derogate from the intent or purpose; it is precisely these types of  minor variations from the strict rules that are desirable in circumstances such as these, where petitioners face a hardship, and the requested variance will allow for improvements to the existing housing stock of the City, and will improve access to light and to the outdoors, particularly for those with mobility issues.","This single-family townhouse style structure was constructed under prior ordinance provisions allowing for a higher FAR and smaller rear yard setbacks. The unique townhouse style structure, interior configuration with the main level (kitchen) being located well above grade, and due to sloping topography of the lot, all result in difficulties providing a safe means of accessing the outdoors from the main level of the house.","Since this structure was built under prior ordinance provisions which allowed for a smaller rear setback, any window or door opening changes within the rear setback will require special permit relief. With the exception of the alterations that are the subject of the related variance, all other construction conforms to zoning requirements.","The installation of a glass sliding door at the rear of this structure will not generate traffic, congestion, hazard or a substantial change in neighborhood character. It will simply allow for direct access to a new modestly-sized rear deck.","There will be no adverse affects to the continued operation of adjacent uses on account of a new sliding glass door in this location. Such conditions are common place in residential neighborhoods throughout the City, and will not cause issues for abutters or others in the District.",,,Boston,MA,10/16/2019

The previous unsuccessful commercial history of the property is evidence that due to its location and lack of foot traffic from Central Square any successful retail would need to draw from the surrounding neighborhood as well as Massachusetts ave.

The design and layout of the restaurant focuses primarily on food with alcohol as a compliment.,The hardship is owing to the non-conforming nature of the property as a mixed use property whose ground floor commercial space is not suitable for the allowed residential use.  Additionally the distance to Central Square and other restaurants requires Petitioner's restaurant to provide similar offerings including alcoholic beverages.,,,,,,Cambridge,MA,07/11/2014

They have always planned in their later years to move into the smaller unit (62 Grozier). They now realize that 62 Grozier is too small for their needs. They request to be allowed to take a portion of the two car garage to increase their living space. They love their home and hope to not have to find accomodations elsewhere.,"The obsevable requested changes will impact only the front elevation in that the garage door will be reduced in width from 16'-0"" to 8""-9"", there will be the addition of a high strip window and a strip of permeable pavement (4'-6"") to park the second car alongside an existing 6'-0"" high fence partially within the front yard under special extreme parking conditions, which rarely occur.","As the structure will maintain its mass and usage the FAR adjustment will not affect the overall intent of the zoning ordinance. Further the operative parking solution over the last 38 years has been to leave the second garage space unused and to park on Grozier Road, a limited access lightly used street. It is the experience of the petioners that Grozier Road has typically had sufficient on-streer parking for residents guest and service users.","The existing garage was designed to meet the requirements for one space per dwelling unit in 1981. This requirement was translated to a walled enclosure of 17 feet wide. Practically, one finds that the room available for a driver to exit a parked vehicle, while accomodating room for a second space, is extemely difficult and near impossible for an elderly passenger to exit.",We propose to eliminate a required second off-street parking space for the 62-64 Grozier Road property.,Grozier Road is limited access lightly used street with legal parking for local residents on both sides.  Experience has shown that there is adequate on-street parking for all including guests and services users.,"Due to the insufficient space in the existing two-car garage, a car assigned to the property has typically parked over the years on the street without a problem.  The owners of this two-family residence have lived at this location in the larger unit for 38 years.  They would like to relocate to the smaller unit and expand their living space by 7'-6"" into the existing garage leaving one accessible parking space.","Given that this proposal will esentially result in recognition of a continued use and given that its impact has not to date resulted in any nuisance or hazard to the occupants or the citizens of the City, one can anticipate that there will not be any noticeable impact in the future.","As there is sufficient legal on-street parking on Grozier Road, this proposal should have no noticeable impact to the abutters and certainly not beyond the district or the adjoining districts.",Cambridge,MA,10/23/2019

Petitioner was before this Board of Zoning Appeal seeking special permit relief in order to alter window openings and install a door within setbacks which was granted (BZA-016276-2018). At that time, plans called for ceiling heights in the basement to remain below 7  feet. After renovations in the basement were nearly completed, Petitioner was informed by Inspectional Services that the newly installed bathroom in the basement would have to conform to the commercial building code requirement of 7 feet ceilings, thus rendering the new bathroom non-compliant due to its current ceiling height of 6 ft, 11 inches. Thus, Petitioner now seeks this Special Permit to exempt from the Gross Floor Area the areas of the basement shown on the plans as a bathroom, laundry and finished room. Such exemption meets the standards set forth in Ordinance Article 2, Gross Floor Area, Excluded, footnote 16, where such basement use otherwise meets all other dimensional requirements under Article 5.31 and will not otherwise exacerbate any existing non-conformity of the building. Furthermore, renovations have either been completed (eg., installation of the new bathroom and laundry), occuring within the existing structure, and will have no impact on neighboring uses and are consistent with similar basement uses in the area.","Petitioner's requested relief and proposed renovation in the existing basement will not result in additional bedrooms nor otherwise allow for additional occupancies in the dwelling. Additionally, the requested exemption will have no impact on patterns of access or egress from the dwelling.  Thus, the Special Permit relief will have no impact on traffic, congestion hazard, or changes to the neighborhood character. And in fact, such minimal use of the basement of the structure is in keeping with similar residential uses in this district and throughout the City of Cambridge, allowing for improved living conditions for residents of three-family residences.","For reasons described above, there will be no adverse impacts on adjacent uses as a result of the requested relief.","There will be no nuisance or hazard created as a result of allowing the basement renovations as described herein, and in fact such renovations will improve health and safety for the occupants of the building.","The proposed renovations to create livable space, including a code compliant bathroom, laundry and finished room in the basement of this three-family dwelling will not impair the integrity of the district, as it would conform with a growingly common phenomena for homeowners of seeking to maximize use of limited residential space within aged, pre-existing, non-conforming three-family structures within residential neighborhoods throughout the City of Cambridge. In fact, this type of relief is consistent with the type of accomodation the City is seeking to allow for when it voted to pass the basement exemption amendment to the Zoning Ordinance.",Boston,MA,09/04/2019

The hardships are functional deprivation and unreasonable reduction of home comfort and value.","The proposed addition, if allowed, will not encroach into setbacks more than the existing structure.  The inline extension of the existing kitchen wing would be located in an area that is principally occupied by the existing entry sequence but will present a more attractive appearance from the street.","The health of the house and its inhabitants is improved by adding a buffer from the outside elements and increased safety from a partially covered landing.  The addition preserves access to light and air by its demure size and location which will cast no shadows beyond the property boundaries.  It is rational to replace poorly functioning entry sequence occupying underutilized land area with a more secure entry and functional interior space.  The value of the home and the property will be increased by the proposed addition.  Congestion in the street will not be affected as the one-car parking space (11'x19', exceeding minimum code) is being conserved.","The shape of the home on its narrow lot and the layout of the first floor rooms make the location of the current entry door good for entering the living areas -- except that there is no buffer from the weather.  The location and shape of the existing structure present a clear, unobtrusive space for the proposed addition.  The eastern end of this space is currently occupied by an uncovered wood entry porch and steps, leaving a dead space between it and the existing kitchen wing which the proposed entry/mudroom would include and connect.  Except for a single 11"" stone step, the addition's encroachment into the side yard setback is les than the existing side yard encroachment.

In 1980, the BZA granted zoning relief to allow for parking of two compact cars in this location, in connection with a variance to allow for the conversion of the garage to a single-family residence. Parking for two vehicles would have been necessary in order for the second dwelling unit to comply with minimum parking requirements. Notwithstanding this 1980 Decision, there is now uncertainty as to whether the special permit was ever acted upon with regard to parking.  Recent history suggests the parking area may not have been widened enough (to the full proposed 14 ft. wide) or used for two cars as proposed. This case arises as a result of a query from a prospective purchaser of one of the newly created condominium units and the Building Commissioner’s determination that he could not confirm, upon the evidence presented, that a second parking space is legally established in this location.A literal enforcement of the ordinance imposes substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, on the owners of this two-family residential property, rendering the property non-compliant in terms of the minimum parking requirements.  There are no alternative parking plans that would comply with dimensional requirement of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.  The plans presented to the BZA represent a plan with the most minimal impacts on neighboring uses with the most minimal zoning relief necessary.  There are no physical alterations required in order to create the parking area called for in this application (16 ft., 2 inches wide and 18 ft., 10 inches deep). The only physical change from the perspective of the neighborhood would be the use of such space for the parking of two (instead of one) vehicles.","Variance relief from the requirements of Section 6.44.1(c) may be granted without any detriment to the public good.  There is currently (and by right) a parking area located in the front yard setback that has been used for at least 35 years for the parking of one vehicle.  There will be minimal impacts to neighbor of an addition of one vehicle in this location.  Similar front yard parking conditions occur throughout the neighborhood and the District and throughout the City.  There already exists a curb cut in this location. Allowing an additional vehicle to park in this location will result in improved conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioners are able to park two cars on their property, thereby removing a car from on street parking in this neighborhood, which will have a net positive benefit for the public. There will be no adverse impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In fact, the changes to parking will improve these conditions, guaranteeing that the Petitioner is able to park on their Property (and not on the City street).","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing for the benefit of the Petitioners and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the siting of the structures on this undersized lot, and the prior grant of a variance to allow for use as a two-family residence together with a grant of rights to park two (2) vehicles that may not have been acted upon by a prior owner.

Total 1st floor square footage 2,224 sqft.","A)	The subject premises have historically (since its construction) had a ground floor commercial use.  In 2010, the prior owner petitioned for a variance to add and construct a second story on the building to accommodate two new residential units.  At the time, the then petitioner asked to memorialize the commercial use of the first floor.  The Board granted a variance for five (5) uses, all under Section 4.35 of the CZO (subsections 1, c, d, e, and r), one of which was a restaurant use.  The current Petitioners operate a food incubator laboratory which researches and develops food products for manufacturing by third parties.  When the Petitioner sought a permit to do renovations to accommodate this planned use, ISD gave them a permit under the restaurant use category previously approved.  The Petitioners subsequently sought a Certificate of Occupancy to satisfy USDA requirements, and while their work passed all inspections (there was a question involving the fire department now resolved) ISD then decided that the proper use category for the facility would be under CZO Section 4.34 (f) (technical office for research and development) because no food is actually served at this location.  It would be a significant hardship for the Petitioner to now have to relocate its business after considerable investment in this location and because the actual use is less intensive than a restaurant use.  The Petitioner has operated in the space for more than two years with no neighborhood issues, and no parking concerns (there are usually no more than six employees on site, many of whom commute by bike) and no delivery issues as there would be with a restaurant use.","The current use is far less intrusive than the other uses permitted by the 2011 variance, and any of such uses would cause far more congestion and traffic and parking issues than the present (and proposed) use by the Petitioner.","Because of the previous “grandfather” status of the space as commercial, and the small footprint of this space along a major Cambridge thoroughfare, the present use by Petitioners does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the CZO since there are many other commercial uses in existence along Western Avenue and the business of the Petitioners complements the neighborhood rather than detracting from it.","The hardship is unique to this structure because it was originally built for commercial use, and following the construction of the two new units on the second story, it would now be costly to redo the first floor for a permitted residential use (with no parking available).",,,,,,Boston,MA,09/11/2019

This property consists of two, single-family structures: a front building originally constructed in approximately 1865, being renovated,, and a new single-family structure located behind.  The renovation and new construction are underway pursuant to a building permit previously issued by the City of Cambridge.  The petitioner seeks to make modifications to the approved plans in order to construct a rear landing and stairs off the rear of the front building on the property, in order to create a means of egress from the first floor of the front building down to the patio and yard.  The landing and stairs would vastly improve the egress conditions for future owners, while minimizing negative impacts to the neighboring properties and this historic neighborhood.  The landing and stairs would only minimally encroach (less than 3 feet) into required space between the two buildings required pursuant to Article 5, Section 5.13 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance of 11.2 feet.  The shortest distance measured between the exterior foundation walls of the two buildings is 11.9 ft, which is greater than the minimum required distance of 11.2 feet.  The landing and stairs located within the space between the buildings meet the requirements described in Article 5, Section 5.24.1 (“unenclosed steps, unroofed porches and the like which do not project more than ten (10) feet beyond the line of the foundation wall and which are not over four (4) feet above the average level of the adjoining ground”), and thus pursuant to Section 5.24.1, the landing and stairs should be allowed to “extend beyond the minimum yard regulations otherwise provided for the district in which the structure is built.”  Under this interpretation, the landing and stairs would be permissible, without requirement of a variance.  However, in the event that the Board does not agree with this interpretation and in the alternative, the Petitioner hereby requests the Board find that the modest encroachment requested in this application be allowed as a variance, since a literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from making a desirable improvement to this home.","The requested relief may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because the encroachment into the space between the two buildings is minimal (less than 3 feet), and will not be visible to the public. There will be no negative impacts to the abutters.  In fact, the siting of the landing and stairs will pose the least impact on abutters, due to their location tucked behind the existing front building.  Any alternative location for this second means of egress would be less desirable and more detrimental to the public good, by creating more substantial encroachment into the right-side setback, or jutting out left of the structure and thereby detracting from the historic design of the front building and intruding into the open space.There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to vastly improve the egress conditions for the front building, and allow for the preservation of open space on the property.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the structure, the topography (sloping down) of the lot, which results in the necessity of a rear landing and stairs down from the first floor to grade at the rear of the structure.  Additionally, the front building is an historic structure, and the design of the second egress is constrained by historic design considerations that are unique to this property.","Petitioner seeks to add one basement window on the right side of the front building on the property.  This new window is necessary and desirable to improve light and air ventilation in the basement of this building.  As it is located on the right side of the building which is pre-existing, nonconforming within the side yard setback, the installation of the window requires a special permit in accordance with Section 8.22.1.d.","Proposed renovation project will result in no additional traffic, change in traffic, or change in the established neighborhood character, but will vastly improve the conditions within the home.","No change in use will occur as a result of the proposed basement window of the house, and adjacent uses will not be adversely affected by the requested special permit relief.  The basement window will be screened from view of the neighboring property by plantings and a four-foot high picket fence and will therefore not be seen by the immediate neighbors or the public passing by on the street.","As described above, no nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief, as the basement window will be screened from view of the neighboring property by plantings and a four-foot high picket fence.","The requested special permit relief can be granted without impairing the integrity of the District or adjoining district, because the new basement window will be in keeping with standard residential construction and consistent with neighborhood uses.",Boston,MA,10/15/2020

The requested signage is required to create a sufficient sense of place and identity to attract residents and produce a financeable project.  As described below, the Property and Building are bordered on one side by an elevated bridge (the Gilmore Bridge) and on the Building’s front, across Glassworks Avenue, by a much taller building.  The Gilmore Bridge restricts the ability to construct a through street to the Property, as Glassworks Avenue dead ends at the Gilmore Bridge.  This creates a lack of visibility and through traffic, making it difficult to attract potential tenants to the Property.  Accordingly, literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship to the Petitioner.  Without the place and identity making ability created by the requested signs, sufficient residents will not be attracted to the Property as required for the progress and development of the North Point neighborhood to a “more productive and attractive use.”","The requested variances can be granted without detriment to the public good as described below.  The Project will not cast shadows on adjacent private properties due to the slender width of the signs.  The signs do not extend over public sidewalks and have been designed to minimize the potential for ice or snow falling from them.  The signs are not artificially lit, and therefore will not cast light on adjacent properties.  The signs will be primarily visible from the Gilmore Bridge and to future residents arriving at the Property, so the signs will not create undue visual clutter when seen from other private properties.  In addition, the signs have been designed with a style and color to complement the architecture of the Building.  As recognized by the Planning Board’s recommendation letter, the sign design takes into account the changes of the former industrial district, its redevelopment into a mixed use district, and the particular nature of this site, which is surrounded by dense development.  Further, the Project will enhance the public good by allowing the rehabilitation of the existing Building, will bring increased vibrancy to the North Point neighborhood and, as described above, will help to continue the progress and development of the North Point neighborhood to a “more productive and attractive use.”  Thus, the Project will not be a detriment to the public good.","The relief requested can be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  According to Section 13.71 of the Ordinance, the North Point PUD District is “intended to provide the opportunity to create a new residential neighborhood from an area now primarily industrial in character” and it is also intended that development in the North Point PUD District “will be generally consistent with the policy objectives set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.”  According to Section 7.11.2 of the Ordinance, the purposes of the Ordinance’s sign regulations include to preserve and enhance the substantial interests of the City of Cambridge in the appearance of the City; to preserve and enhance the public interest in the aesthetics; to preserve and increase amenities of the City; and to control and reduce visual clutter and blight.The Project involves signs that will facilitate and further the place and identity-making of the North Point neighborhood.  The neighborhood is in the early stages of transitioning from an area formerly industrial in nature, and containing blighted railroad land, to one that is residential and that will contain a vibrant residential neighborhood, consistent with the intent of Section 13.70 of the Ordinance.  Transitioning away from these older industrial uses to residential uses is also consistent with the policy objectives in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and guidance provided in the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.  Further, the signs will conform to the intent and purpose of Section 7.11.2 of the Ordinance.  The proposed signs will help preserve and enhance the substantial interests of the City in the appearance of the City and preserving and enhancing the public interest in aesthetics by being well designed, integrated additions to the Building that will enhance its aesthetics.  With the requested variances, the Petitioner will be able to complete the overall rehabilitation of the Building and will create the residential use desired by the Ordinance.  In addition, the signs are designed in such a manner that controls and reduces visual clutter and blight.","The physical conditions of the Property and Building described in this subsection cause the financial hardships described above.  These conditions are especially applicable to the Property and not to the other parcels in the North Point PUD District.As stated above, the Property and Building have a long and narrow shape that is bordered on one side by an elevated bridge and, on the Building’s front, across Glassworks Avenue, by a much taller building.  The Gilmore Bridge restricts the ability to construct a through street serving the Property; it is serviced by a dead end street terminating at the elevated Gilmore Bridge.  The narrowness of the Property and Building, together with their physical location on a dead end street and adjacent to an elevated bridge and tall buildings create a lack of visibility and through traffic, making it difficult to attract potential tenants and residents to the Property.  The physical conditions of the Property and Building, namely the narrowness of the Property and Building, and the conditions caused by the adjacent Gilmore Bridge, dead end Glassworks Avenue, and nearby tall buildings, create a hardship not generally applicable to the North Point PUD District.  These physical conditions cause the financial hardships described above.  Approving the sign variances, will allow the Project to succeed and will help get the greater North Point neighborhood project progressing again.",,,,,,Boston,MA,03/27/2015

We live in the upper floor of a two-family home, and we would like to add on a third story to have additional living space.  However, our 2-family, built in 1889, is already non-conforming regarding setbacks and just barely over allowable FAR and therefore adding any additional space reqiures zoning approval.  A literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would not permit us to add any space to our home.  We have investigated relocation and find ourselves priced out of the local real-estate market for homes of reasonable size for a family of four.",1) The proposed modestly propoortioned design would enable our house to fit into the neighborhood well in both style and scale.  It would match the gable roof designs of the five contiguous neighboring and adjacent houses to the north and be similar to those homes in scale.  The homes to the south are also comparable in scale and style.  2) We conducted a shadow study and carefully incorporated its findings in our design in order to ensure that the impact of this new construction on our neighbors light exposure is minimal.3) We would not be reducing open space at all or adding additional impervious surfaces.  All existing open green space would be preserved.4) Our modest design reflects special care to preserve the character and ornamental detailing ofthis 125 yer old house.  The existing and orignal Queen Anne ornamental parapet will remain the dominant visual feature of the front elevation.,"The proposed space we desperately need can be accomplished accordingly:1) We are not proposing changing the footprint of the building or the amount of open space on our lot.  We are not adding new people or traffic to the area nor are we reducing the amount of off street parking.2) The new dormer components are designed in accordance with the Cambridge Dormer Guidelines:  recessed 12"" down from the main gable ridge, 15' in length, 70% window glazing on the dormer walls.  The existing stair on the north exterior wall does compell the dormer front walls to align with the house side walls, but the continuous 18"" eave running on both sides of the house does create the desired effect.3) Our roof is currently the lowest on the block, so it is not out of character with the neighborhood to bring it higher.  More than half of the buildings on our street and all the ones behind us have three levels of living space.  Larger buildings also abutt our neighborhood such as the MLK school and the Cambridge Community Center and Putnam Gardens directly across the street.4) Our proposed design has been reviewed and apporoved by our neighbors and has no negative impact on the public in general.5) Our proposed design will enhance not only our house, but will also be an attractive addition to the streetscape.",Our pre-existing non-conforming house and lot size make it impossible to adhere fully to the set back and FAR provisions of the zoning ordinance while at the same time providing the additional space our family needs.,,,,,,Cambridge,MA,09/10/2015

Use of the basement space for a one-bedroom Accessory Apartment will not be materially different in terms of impact on neighboring uses than the current use of this space.,"No nuisance or hazard will be created as a result of the proposed special permit relief because the alterations to the structure are minimal and the proposed use will not be substantially different from the current use, and Accessory Apartment use is generally consistent with uses in the neighborhood.","Section 4.22 states as follows: “Alteration of these buildings [single and two-family dwellings] to provide one additional dwelling unit on the lot would be prohibited in most cases due to the existing floor area ratio and/or lot area per dwelling unit requirements of Subsection 5.31, among other zoning limitations. Given contemporary lifestyles, housing needs, and energy and maintenance costs, it is beneficial to the City to allow greater flexibility in the use of such buildings to add new dwelling units without substantially altering the environmental quality of their surrounding neighborhoods. This Subsection 4.22 gives the Board of Zoning Appeal the authority to relax such requirements  in certain instances as enumerated below.” Where the petition proposes a modest alteration to an existing single-family dwelling that meets the requirements for a Special Permit as set forth in Section 4.22.1 and does not otherwise impair or adversely impact neighboring uses or the District, this Board is urged to approve the requested petition and grant the necessary relief in furtherance of the City’s stated objectives.",Boston,MA,10/15/2020

She has two children, one postcollege and one in college, who work/live and plan to work/live, in cambridge. The children were raised in this house on the second floor, which was designed as a two-bedroom apartment, by converting the small living room into a bedroom. The first floor apartment has been rented out so as to provide income for the family. The applicant's children intend to remain in their house in order to be able to afford to live in Cambridge, where rents have become outrageously high for middle-income earners, but the cramped quarters of the second floor apartment are not conducive to the lives of three co-habiting adults, or for a future family.

The first floor level is, also, relatively close to grade which in combination with the paltry sideyard space means that getting windows in to provide decent daylight or egress is almost impossible.

Most of the existing structures in the area are non-conforming with respect to F.A.R., Height, Setbacks, or Lot Area per Dwelling Unit.  In addition, 77 Inman lies within the Mid Cambridge Neighborhood District which requires review with the MCNCDC further limiting  alterations that enable the structure  to adapt to changing needs. A literal enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would make the desirable renovation and restoration of the existing structure infeasible.","77 Inman has existed as a Two-Family Residence with 1 compliant parking space for years.  The existing non-conformity is due to a 1.1' defecit in the Front Yard Setback, a common non-conformity throughout the neighborhood.

The increase in size of the structure is in keeping with the sizes of the structures in the neighborhood and will conform with all other aspects of the building and zoning regulations.",The relief requested will permit an addition to the existing structure which will create a total gross floor area which is in keeping with the FAR of most of the adjacent properties and complies with the allowable FAR in the District.  The lot coverage remains consistent with the adjacent properties in the neighborhood.  The changes do not increase the building height and do not create any new setback violations.  The number of Dwelling Units and Parking Spaces will not change.  Open space requirement will be met.,"Hardship is owing to the location of this existing Structure on this specific lot.  The cost of restoration, the demolition and/or reuse of outdated structural and fire-preventative construction methods, the limitations placed by both the MCNCDC and Zoning Non-Conformity combine to render the economic adaptation and reuse of the building unlikely at 77 Inman Street.  These difficulties do not exist on an empty lot where the Ordinance can be applied in a practical, versatile way.

However,  (3) entirely safe and workable compact spaces can fit, and allow each car to enter, park and exit without the other cars in the area needing to move. The neighboring houses are consistently non-conforming in this regard, and the proposed site plan, parking arrangement and structure will fit the neighborhood pattern.","The requirement for parking 3 cars- 1 for each of the 3 apartments -  will be met, though the 5' property line setback required by code will be reduced to 2 feet.  A reduced parking setback is prevalent throughout the neighborhood, and with this plan, will allow maneuvering in and out of the on-site parking spaces without requiring another resident to move their car.","Traffic generated by this 3 family building will be negligible because the 3 cars parked on the site will be off-street.  Additionally, the property's location within walking distance of public transportation and major employment centers will be major attractor for prospective residents.",This proposed new development would refill a lot vacant since the devastating fire; it would be an addition to the residential character of the neighborhood.,"Parking 3 cars off-street, but within 2' of the lot line (rather than code requested 5'),  would not be of any detriment to the health, safety or welfare of the new building's residents or to the neighborhood.

Due to the currently non-conforming nature of the lot (undersized), and structure which does not comply with modern dimensional standards in terms of FAR (currently 0.64) and setbacks (structure located very close to the front lot line and within side yard setbacks, even these very modest and necessary improvements to the house will minimally increase the current non-conformity. Under a recent Supreme Judicial Court decision, Maria Bellalta & another vs. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline & others, SJC-12516, Slip Opinion dated February 8, 2019, such de minimus alterations to a pre-existing non-conforming single-family structure such as this one should be allowed to proceed with a finding of this Board under G.L. c. 40A, Section 6, upon a finding of “no substantial detriment” – in essence, a special permit standard. (See a copy of the Slip Opinion for Bellalta v. ZBA Brookline, included in this BZA application).  The Petitioner has been advised by the Commissioner of Inspectional Services that this Board may not hear this case on such basis unless and until the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance has been amended to reflect the import of the Bellalta decision.  Thus, the Petitioner hereby requests the Board find that the modest alterations requested in this application be allowed as a variance under Article 5, Section 5.3000, since a literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from making necessary and desirable improvements to this single-family home. The following alterations result in an increase in Floor Area requiring a variance: a) expand existing small (approx. 5 ft. 9 inch. wide) shed dormer on the left side of the home increasing to approximately 11 ft. wide) and b) construct matching approximately 11 ft. wide shed dormer on the right side of the home, these dormers allowing for the Petitioner to create living space in the attic level for his two grown children to visit or occasionally reside with him; and c) converting front covered sun porch into living space (no increase in Floor Area) and reconstruct front stairs and entry to the home within the front yard setback, such changes being desired in order to provide a safer, code compliant, and weather tight entry to the home.","The relief from Dimensional Standards of Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because the changes are very minimal – an expansion of an existing dormer and matching relatively small dormer resulting in a very small increase in Floor Area, and new front stairs and entry, within the front yard setback.  The expanded dormer and new dormer are less than the allowable 15 feet dormer, are set back from the street in compliance with dimensional standards, and will not negatively impact the neighbors.  The new front stairs and entry are consistent with the style of entries in this neighborhood, including other homes along Clarendon Avenue. There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to proceed with plans to undertake a significant renovation to this single-family home that will allow for him to improve living conditions and reside here with his family.  As such, a grant of variance relief will allow for the rehabilitation and improvement of a single-family home and restoration of existing housing stock that will be desirable for future residents.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will: a) create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners; b) not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance; and c) not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the undersized and narrow lot, aged and relatively small single-family structure located within front yard and side yard setbacks.  The modest (61 square feet) increase in Floor Area are the result of alterations that are necessary for the reasons stated above.",,,,,,Boston,MA,09/27/2019

The Owner was also granted a Special Permit for a Reduction of Parking.After that BZA hearing and approval, a more extensive investigation of the building condition revealed several issues.  Primary was the fact that there is an active water table just below the existing basement slab.  The initial plans of digging down the basement space down to provide for a more usable basement storage area had to be reconsidered.  One option would have been to dig down below the water table and to install a waterproof foundation, with a 24 hours groundwater pumping to the storm drain.  This proved both prohibitively expensive, and was rejected by the Cambridge DPW.  In conversations with the DPW, they described that this area at Columbia and Harvard Streets is already underserved by the City stormwater system, and therefore highly susceptible to flooding in the near future.  In order to work around the high water table, we discussed with the DPW the possibility of leaving the existing foundation, and raising the building to avoid the inevitable flooding of the 1st floor retail spaces.  The DPW was supportive of this proposal.  Therefore we are proposing leaving the existing foundation in place, which has been determined by our structural engineer to be stable and suitable for reconstruction of the upper building and living units.  However the removal of the building above grade triggers a new set of required zoning  relief that is beyond what was granted by the BZA on October 11, 2018.  We are proposing to rebuild the existing structure, plus the residential units granted by the BZA on 10/11/18, with the new first floor level at approximately 24” above the current first floor sidewalk grade.  This will ensure protection from inevitable future flooding.  This new proposal will require the following zoning relief as follows:•	Variance for commercial use in the C-1 zone•	Variance for setbacks•	Variance for FAR, as per the earlier 10/11/18 BZA approval•	(SP) for parking relief, as per the earlier 10/11/18 BZA approvalIn addition, the Owner will be applying to the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board (AAB) for a variance to create a handicap ramp that is not at the primary access points.  That Variance is in process.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would involve a substantial hardship, since groundwater was found just below the surface of the existing basement slab.  It is not financially possible to lower the basement level to provide adequate storage space.  The solution is to raise the level of the first floor.",Desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good because the residential use is consistent with the multifamily properties along Columbia Street and the maintaining the ground floor retail use (Camie's Bakery) will continue to be an asset to community and activate the street-scape.,"The requested relief will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of this Ordinance because the requested relief will result in the same building that was approved by the BZA on October 11, 2018.  It was for that earlier application that the community was is great support of the project.  The requested project will result in a fully upgraded building, as well as the much needed addition to the Cambridge housing stock.","The hardship is owing to the building being constructed just above a high water table, and the fact that the area is prone and susceptible to flooding in the near future (according to the Cambridge DPW).  The existing condition of the existing structure is poor, and modification will be more expensive that a reconstruction.",With the requested Special Permit the requirements of the Ordinance can be satisfied.,"Traffic generated or patterns of access or egress will not cause congestion, hazard or substantial change in the neighborhood character.  All requested zoning relief replicates the project approved by the BZA on October 11, 2018, with the rebuilding of the existing retail, and the creation of 2 residential units above.The Columbia Street Corridor contains mixed use properties that enliven the street and add much needed neighborhood amenities to the Port Neighborhood.","The continued operation or development of adjacent uses would not be adversely affected because the proposed uses replicated the previous commercial uses, as well as the previously approved residential, which will be of a scale and character consistent with the surrounding properties.","No nuisance or hazard will be created to the detriment of the health, safety and/or welfare of the occupants of the proposed use or citizens because the residential dwellings will conform to the setbacks and other dimensional regulations where possible.","The intent and purpose of the Ordinance is to promote the highest and best use of Land throughout the City.

Additionally, backing out from the existing garage onto Appleton Street is somewhat dangerous under current conditions for pedestrians and vehicles passing by on Appleton Street. The Petitioner's plans involve demolishing the existing detached two-car garage (with its high-pitched roof, located within 9.2 feet of the front lot line on Appleton Street) and construction an attached two-car garage and in-law/au pair living space that is built into the slope of the rear/side of this corner lot.  Plans also include a modest expansion and modernization of the kitchen, resulting in a modest increase in GFA.  These changes will improve conditions for duture homeowners, as well as this historic neighborhood.The proposed one-story addition, extending behind the main portion of the house, set into the sloping grade of the lot, is designed so as to maximize efficiency for construction and living purposes, and minimize impacts on the neighborhood.  Proposed changes to the on-site parking will also improve safety for veicles and pedestrians with improved visibility for vehicles entering and existing the site along Appleton Street.Variance Relief is required in order to permit the following:1) Increase in Gross Floor Area that amounts to a more than 25% increase in Gross Floor Area.  It should be noted that the increase in volume is less than 25% (23% increase in volume);2) Modes (by 1.9 feet) enclroachment for the garage/lower-level addition into the front yard setback along Appleton Street; and 3) Very moinor (44 feet) exceeding of the maxium allowable Floor Area Ratio for the District (with FAR requested at .5028 instead of .5000)A literal enforcent of the Ordinance would result in hardship to the petitioner and future owners of this Property by prohibiting the above described improvements that will provide for: better accessibility for homeowners, demolition of the large, encroaching garage, a more efficient use of land, a more desirable design improving views of this histric home from Appleton Street, and safer vehicular parking and access/egress to the site.","The relief from Section 5.31 may be granted without detriment to the public good.  The increase in GFA results in an FAR just barely above the maximum 0.50 for the District, in a neighborhood of homes that are quite substantial in size.  The increase in GFA of more than 25% will be less impactful than these GFA numbers may suggest.  The following factors (the result of how the ordinance defines certain areas as either included or excluded GFA) contributes to the sizable GFA increase for the project:   a) The existing GFA excludes the floor area within the existing detached two-car garage;b) The proposed GFA exempts floor area for only one vehicle bay of the proposed attached garage, and includes floor area for the second vehicle bay; and c) The proposed GFA includes floor area in the lower-level addition which is an extension of the existing basement of the main portion of the house. Due to changes in grade on the lot, the rear portion of the basement/lower level counts as a “story above grade” and thus all floor area (with the exception of one vehicle bay) in the proposed garage/lower level addition is included in the calculation of the proposed GFA. There will be no impact to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  As described above, the proposed changes, including demolition of the existing encroaching garage, will result in a net positive effect for those in the neighborhood and passersby.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioners to proceed with plans to make much needed improvements to allow for this historic, single-family to be updated for use by future residents, including those with families, elderly or physically disabled residents who would otherwise be deterred from residing in a home without these necessary improvements.  The requested variance will contribute to the improvement of the aging housing stock in a manner that is respectful of the neighborhood and the District.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioners, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the unique constellation of features of the land and the structure including: a) The topography of the land, which slopes down towards the right, rear of the lot; andb) The interior structure and layout of the existing Victorian era home, with its relatively small kitchen at the rear and difficult access route from the house out to the garage and rear yard. The topography and structure of the home together results in difficulties with accessibility for homeowners.  The existing detached garage is located at the rear of the house along Appleton Street, at the same (or lower) grade as basement/lower level of the house.  The homeowner who wishes to enter or leave her or his home by car must navigate steep and dangerous stairs from the kitchen down to the basement level, exit the rear basement door, walk outside on uneven ground to reach the exterior garage. Similarly, access to the rear/side yard is via this basement egress door, making it difficult for homeowners to access and enjoy the open space on the lot.  c) The shape of the land, a corner lot, and location of the existing structures (house and detached garage) within the front yard setback along Appleton Street, also contributes to the hardship in the following respect. The proposed addition is designed to align as an extension of the existing house for aesthetic and structural reasons.  As such, the proposed addition continues the existing non-conformity of the front setback along Appleton Street.  The existing structure is 22.8 feet from the front lot line, and the proposed addition is slightly further back, at 23.1 feet from the front lot line.   The combination of these factors creates the hardship for the Petitioner and any future homeowner.  The removal of the detached garage and replacement with an attached garage drives the majority of the increase in GFA that arises, as a result of various aspects of the Ordinance definitions of included and excluded GFA, for the reasons described below.",,,,,,Boston,MA,11/20/2020

First, it would require us to move the sides of each of our homes inwards several feet to create full size parking spaces. This would be exorbitantly expensive. In addition, this would make our homes uninhabitable for a substantial period of time, for both the owners of 41-43 and 45 Magoun St of each and tenants in 41-43 Magoun St. Another alternative would be to physically move both homes, but then it would violate setback requirements on the other side of each home. Second, placing the parking lot in the backyard would involve substantial logistical hardship and ability to comply with other Cambridge ordinances. Our backyards are lower in elevation and in a flood zone. Attempting to create a parking lot there would involve significant expense for proper drainage, so as to avoid flooding in the yards of our abuttors behind. It would also require both owners to rebuild or move our back decks, which would also be prohibitively expensive and could violate setback requirements. Lastly, both properties have several very large, old (approx 75-100 years old, >6’’ caliper) trees in the backyards providing shade to multiple homes and a significant amount of vegetation. A parking lot there could require removal of those trees (violating Cambridge ordinances), or could cause damage to them due to proximity to moving cars that might bang them, or a parking lot reducing rain water infiltrating the ground near the trees. This would make for a dangerous situation for the owners and several abuttors.","Relief will not involved substantial detriment to the public good but will actually provide a clear and obvious benefit. It will remove four cars from the street in the space of one car. It will also increase safety for a number of reasons (see comments in Special Permit application and letters of support from abuttors across the street). We have support of our neighbors for this project. In addition, our neighborhood is full of driveways/parking spaces in the front and side of homes, not in the backyards (see images). Adding parking spots to the backyard to create a full five spots would turn the backyard into a parking lot, impact vegetation and tree coverage, and derogate the nature of the neighborhood. Surrounding properties typically do not have parking in the back; they are typically in the front and side of the house.","The general intent of the ordinances mentioned, as articulated in Article 1.30, are to lessen congestion on streets, to improve safety, and to facilitate the provision of open space, among other things. Relief will not derogate from that purpose but in fact enhance and enable it. First, this project will reduce congestion by removing four cars from the street in the equivalent street parking space of just one car. Second, it will improve safety for the property owners involved (see below), as well as residents across the street who value having an empty space in front of their driveway to safely back out of their driveways (see letter), and those driving down the street, many of whom use it as an artery to avoid Mass Ave traffic. Third, by providing relief, significant amounts of open space in the backyard will be preserved. A note on safety: The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41-43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times. We at 45 Magoun Street are seniors and would like easier access to our cars. Paul is deaf in one ear and has only 40% hearing in the other, making it difficult to hear the fast oncoming traffic when entering the car. In addition, our parked car on the street was recently banged on the side by someone driving down the street (see image). It was extremely stressful to deal with the aftermath and resistance from the insurance company. The parking spaces will also enable better public health and clean air, as it will open up the opportunity for electric cars and less emissions. We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally, and in fact, help achieve some of the main goals of the Cambridge ordinances, as specified above.","The hardship owes to the shape and topography of the land and structures of the two lots. Residence B zoning district encompasses many neighborhoods across Cambridge. Zoning ordinances call for at least 50’ of lot width and 5,000 square feet of lot size, but our lots were designed with only 40’ of width on 4,000 square feet. This means homes on Magoun St were built close to each other. These non-conforming elements make it exceptionally difficult to meet the traditional requirements for off-street parking.","We are applying for a special permit as per 6.43.6, to establish a common driveway with our neighbors under a mutual easement. We, the owners of each 41/43 and 45 Magoun St, intend to record the easement at the Registry of Deeds once we receive the special permit. We also intend to apply for a curb cut permit, whose ordinance requirements are met through our plan and application.","The granting of the special permit, and eventually the curb cut permit, will allow for parking spaces on our own properties and off the street, thus improving the availability of street parking. Our proposal would remove more cars from the street than could park in the length of the curb cut, thus easing congestion (see letters from neighbors). Moreover, we have already spoken with our abuttors, who have provided their approval (see attachment). Lastly, almost all homes on Magoun Street have a curb cut and off-street parking; as such the neighborhood character would not change (see attachment with images).","Creation of the parking from the driveway and the curb cut will not adversely affect the adjacent residential uses. In fact, we as applicants are each the adjacent neighbor that would be most impacted, and we are seeking to create this driveway together for each of our mutual benefits. Properties behind will not be affected as the driveway will not go into the backyard. Neighbors have provided approval for the project.","The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41/43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times.

We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally.","Curb cuts, off-street driveways, and even mutual driveways are common in North Cambridge. We include here photos from our most proximate neighborhood (North Cambridge north of the linear bike path). As such, the proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district, but in fact improve the safety of both the occupants and provide more street parking to others. There is one small tree, about 4-5 inch caliper (less than the 6"" mentioned in the ordinance), that would need to be moved or removed for the curb cut; we include here in our design a plan to either move it to either side of the curb cut, or plant a new one, as per the City’s advice.",Cambridge,MA,09/11/2020

First, it would require us to move the sides of each of our homes inwards several feet to create full size parking spaces. This would be exorbitantly expensive. In addition, this would make our homes uninhabitable for a substantial period of time, for both the owners of 41-43 and 45 Magoun St of each and tenants in 41-43 Magoun St. Another alternative would be to physically move both homes, but then it would violate setback requirements on the other side of each home. Second, placing the parking lot in the backyard would involve substantial logistical hardship and ability to comply with other Cambridge ordinances. Our backyards are lower in elevation and in a flood zone. Attempting to create a parking lot there would involve significant expense for proper drainage, so as to avoid flooding in the yards of our abuttors behind. It would also require both owners to rebuild or move our back decks, which would also be prohibitively expensive and could violate setback requirements. Lastly, both properties have several very large, old (approx 75-100 years old, >6’’ caliper) trees in the backyards providing shade to multiple homes and a significant amount of vegetation. A parking lot there could require removal of those trees (violating Cambridge ordinances), or could cause damage to them due to proximity to moving cars that might bang them, or a parking lot reducing rain water infiltrating the ground near the trees. This would make for a dangerous situation for the owners and several abuttors.","Relief will not involved substantial detriment to the public good but will actually provide a clear and obvious benefit. It will remove four cars from the street in the space of one car. It will also increase safety for a number of reasons (see comments in Special Permit application and letters of support from abuttors across the street). We have support of our neighbors for this project. In addition, our neighborhood is full of driveways/parking spaces in the front and side of homes, not in the backyards (see images). Adding parking spots to the backyard to create a full five spots would turn the backyard into a parking lot, impact vegetation and tree coverage, and derogate the nature of the neighborhood. Surrounding properties typically do not have parking in the back; they are typically in the front and side of the house.","The general intent of the ordinances mentioned, as articulated in Article 1.30, are to lessen congestion on streets, to improve safety, and to facilitate the provision of open space, among other things. Relief will not derogate from that purpose but in fact enhance and enable it. First, this project will reduce congestion by removing four cars from the street in the equivalent street parking space of just one or at most two cars. Second, it will improve safety for the property owners involved (see below), as well as residents across the street who value having an empty space in front of their driveway to safely back out of their driveways (see letter), and those driving down the street, many of whom use it as an artery to avoid Mass Ave traffic. Third, by providing relief, significant amounts of open space in the backyard will be preserved. A note on safety: The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41-43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times. We at 45 Magoun Street are seniors and would like easier access to our cars. Paul is deaf in one ear and has only 40% hearing in the other, making it difficult to hear the fast oncoming traffic when entering the car. In addition, our parked car on the street was recently banged on the side by someone driving down the street (see image). It was extremely stressful to deal with the aftermath and resistance from the insurance company. The parking spaces will also enable better public health and clean air, as it will open up the opportunity for electric cars and less emissions. We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally, and in fact, help achieve some of the main goals of the Cambridge ordinances, as specified above.","The hardship owes to the shape and topography of the land and structures of the two lots. Residence B zoning district encompasses many neighborhoods across Cambridge. Zoning ordinances call for at least 50’ of lot width and 5,000 square feet of lot size, but our lots were designed with only 40’ of width on 4,000 square feet. This means homes on Magoun St were built close to each other. These non-conforming elements make it exceptionally difficult to meet the traditional requirements for off-street parking.","We are applying for a special permit as per 6.43.6, to establish a common driveway with our neighbors under a mutual easement. We, the owners of each 41/43 and 45 Magoun St, intend to record the easement at the Registry of Deeds once we receive the special permit. We also intend to apply for a curb cut permit, whose ordinance requirements are met through our plan and application.","The granting of the special permit, and eventually the curb cut permit, will allow for parking spaces on our own properties and off the street, thus improving the availability of street parking. Our proposal would remove more cars from the street than could park in the length of the curb cut, thus easing congestion (see letters from neighbors). Moreover, we have already spoken with our abuttors, who have provided their approval (see attachment). Lastly, almost all homes on Magoun Street have a curb cut and off-street parking; as such the neighborhood character would not change (see attachment with images).","Creation of the parking from the driveway and the curb cut will not adversely affect the adjacent residential uses. In fact, we as applicants are each the adjacent neighbor that would be most impacted, and we are seeking to create this driveway together for each of our mutual benefits. Properties behind will not be affected as the driveway will not go into the backyard. Neighbors have provided approval for the project.","The welfare of the occupants of the proposed use will be improved as it will provide more safety. Magoun St is straight and flat, suffers from significant through-traffic at high speeds as commuters attempt to bypass the signal at Mass Ave and Alewife Brook Parkway. We at 41/43 Magoun St are parents of a young two-and-a-half year old daughter. When placing her in the back seat, we have almost been hit by oncoming traffic numerous times. We at 45 Magoun Street are seniors and would like easier access to our cars. Paul is deaf in one ear and has only 40% hearing in the other, making it difficult to hear the fast oncoming traffic when entering the car. In addition, our parked car on the street was recently banged on the side by someone driving down the street (see image). It was extremely stressful to deal with the aftermath and resistance from the insurance company. The parking spaces will also enable better public health and clean air, as it will open up the opportunity for electric cars and less emissions. We do not see any detrimental effects from this change to the public generally.","Curb cuts, off-street driveways, and even mutual driveways are common in North Cambridge. We include here photos from our most proximate neighborhood (North Cambridge north of the linear bike path). As such, the proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district, but in fact improve the safety of both the occupants and provide more street parking to others. There is one small tree, about 4-5 inch caliper (less than the 6"" mentioned in the ordinance), that would need to be moved or removed for the curb cut; we include here in our design a plan to either move it to either side of the curb cut, or plant a new one, as per the City’s advice.",Cambridge,MA,09/11/2020

The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Front yard setbacks to Mill Street and Plympton Street(CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum front yard)•	Mill Street: To permit the setback of a new addition 26’-6” from the centerline of Mill Street, a Harvard-owned private way, less than the 77’-4” required of the front yard formula calculation. •	Plympton Street:  To permit the setback of a new addition 2’-6” from the street line of Plympton Street, less than the 5’ minimum, while conforming to the formula requirement to the centerline.Variance 2: Between building setback to 101 Plympton Street(CZO 5.13, Minimum distance between multiple buildings on a lot.)•	To permit a setback of 10’-3”, less than the 15’-7” required of the formula calculation.Variance 3: Alteration and enlargement of a nonconforming structure(CZO 8.22.3)•	To enlarge the legally nonconforming Gore Hall by 28% since it first began to be nonconforming, exceeding the 25% threshold.Harvard University is currently engaged in a system-wide effort to renew Harvard’s undergraduate Houses.  The House system began in the 1930s as a cornerstone to the Harvard College education, creating an integrated living and learning community.  Today, more than 98 percent of Harvard College students live on campus.  Sophomores, juniors, and seniors live in one of twelve undergraduate Houses, including Winthrop House, nine of which are located alongside the Charles River. In 1986, this collection of historic buildings was designated as the Harvard Houses National Register District, considered “a significant and distinguishable entity of imposing Georgian Revival dormitories.”Harvard is planning the renewal and expansion of Winthrop House, with a goal to preserve the historic character and culture of the House while transforming it to support a twenty first-century intergenerational learning community.  The two main buildings comprising Winthrop House, Gore Hall and Standish Hall, were both built as freshmen dormitories in 1916, and were united in 1930 to become one of the founding Harvard Houses.  While some adjustments were made in the 1930, the buildings have always been undersized in terms of residential and common spaces in comparison to the other purpose-built Harvard Houses. Winthrop House students currently live in overflow housing in other campus locations.The proposed Winthrop House renewal project calls for the renovation of Gore Hall and Standish Hall, and the preservation and restoration of two historic wood-frame residential buildings adjacent to Gore Hall. One of the houses, 111 Plympton Street (b. 1899), on the corner of Plympton Street and Memorial Drive, has been continuously part of Winthrop House since 1939.  The second adjacent wood-frame building, 101 Plympton Street (b. 1870), will transition from its current use as a Harvard three-unit affiliate apartment building to residential space associated with Winthrop House as part of this project. Both of these wood-frame structures are also considered contributing buildings in the Harvard Houses National Register District, representing the only two surviving buildings that “recall the area’s nineteenth century history of wharves, light industry, and working class housing” (NRD Nomination Form).This project offers a unique opportunity to address the space challenges faced by this undersized House. Unlike most of the Harvard Houses Historic District, which is composed of dormitories and linked courtyards, Gore Hall is adjacent to potentially the only development site in the whole district.  Until its recent removal, a one-story 1960s utilitarian garage structure sat next to Gore Hall at the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets.  In this location, Harvard proposes to construct a sensitive new east addition to Gore Hall.  The proposed 26,335 square foot addition would comprise a new five-story wing at the corner of Mill and Plympton Streets, a two-story addition facing Memorial Drive that connects to 111 Plympton Street, and an outdoor terrace and below grade common area that spans the two. The proposed height and massing of the new structures has been carefully designed to be a sympathetic neighbor to the surrounding Neo-Georgian masonry buildings as well as the nineteenth century wood-frame buildings. The additional space would create much-needed residential and common spaces, and allow more efficient mechanical equipment and utility layouts.The proposed project will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance with the exception of the following elements which require zoning relief. •	The front yard setback of the proposed new wing to Mill Street is consistent with the current alignment of the existing Gore Hall, which has a 17’ – 25’ setback.  Strict compliance with the calculation of the required front yard setback along Mill Street for a connected addition requires a 77’-4” setback.  The proposed project calls for a 26’-6” setback to allow a general alignment with the existing Gore building and to allow a building footprint that is proportional to the scale of the River Houses without requiring the removal of the adjacent wood-frame building.  The front yard setback in question relates to Mill Street is a Harvard-owned private way, which bisects a large, 13-acre University lot.The front yard setback of the proposed new wing to Plympton Street is consistent with the surrounding historic Harvard buildings, maintaining the street wall condition of its historic context. While the project conforms to the front yard setback formula requirement to the centerline of the street, it is slightly closer to the street line at 2’-6” than the required 5’ minimum.•	The proposed addition meets the building code requirements for the minimum distance to the adjacent Harvard-owned 101 Plympton Street at 10’-3”.  It falls slightly short of the zoning requirement of 15’-7” on the south elevation of the new addition because of the desire to maintain a setback from Mill Street that matches that of the Gore Hall entablature while retaining the adjacent historic structures: 101 and 111 Plympton Street. •	Gore Hall was built in 1916 and predates the introduction of setback and parking and loading requirements. The building is considered legally nonconforming with respect to front yard setbacks, parking, and loading. The proposed project calls for the legally nonconforming building to be enlarged by 28%, which exceeds the 25% threshold and thus requires a variance.A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would require a structure that would be highly incompatible to its historic context in terms of proportions, height, and massing.  Harvard has made historic preservation a priority in this project and has worked closely with the Cambridge Historical Commission to ensure a sensitive design.  Gore Hall and the two wood-frame buildings are contributing buildings in the Harvard Houses National Register District, and therefore the Cambridge Historical Commission has emphasized the importance of preserving all of them in place.  Maintaining these buildings in place is appropriate from a preservation perspective, and particularly when contrasted with the as-of-right development potential on this site.  While it would be technically possible to build an as-of-right new building of the same size east of Gore that met all of the zoning requirements including setbacks, the structure would be grossly out of proportion in terms of height and massing among the Harvard Houses.  Furthermore, any as-of-right new construction would need to be stand-alone development and could not be connected to Gore Hall due to its front yard setback nonconformity.  The as-of-right development would be approximately 30% taller (20”+ not including any rooftop elements) than its Neo-Georgian neighbors. It would be a very narrow building, completely unlike the predominant building form in the historic district.  The as-of-right building would also not match the density of the surrounding buildings.  The incompatibility of the scale of the as-of-right building in this highly visible and much treasured historic district would be inconsistent with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Standards concerning new construction in historic contexts, and likely would be opposed by the state and local historical commissions. The dimensional constraints of an as-of-right building would result in a single-loaded corridor with rooms on only one side – a precedent not found in the Neo-Georgian district.  Finally, to meet the front yard setback requirement to Mill Street, it could not be connected to Gore Hall because any additional width along Mill Street would constitute an extension of Gore Hall’s nonconforming setback to Mill Street, and thus require a zoning variance.  However, the physical connection and alignment to Gore Hall is essential to making the dormitory use work as part of one unified House with shared circulation, common spaces, and support services.  The setback at Plympton Street is carefully aligned with that of McKinlock Hall across Plympton Street as well as the adjacent woodframes at 101 and 111 Plympton Street to maintain the prevailing street wall in this historic district that is at or close to the street line.  The pedestrian environment will benefit from a 9’ sidewalk at this location on Plympton Street, expanded even further at the corner of Mill Street. This historic status and context is not something generally affecting the Residence C-3 zoning district. If the existing wood-frame buildings were removed from the site, Harvard would be able to build a far larger as-of-right development.","This project directly responds to the Cambridge Growth Policy 52, which states that “major educational institutions should be encouraged to provide housing” for their students through “effective use of existing land holdings” in the core campus. Gore Hall is located in the heart of the Harvard Houses National Historic Register District and is surrounded by Harvard dormitories on three sides and the Charles River to the south.  The closest non-Harvard residential abutter to the proposed addition is distant from the site, located approximately 440 feet away and without any sightlines to the property. The development site has been in Harvard ownership since 1912, and represents a unique opportunity to expand the University’s residential facilities, as set out in the City’s Growth Policy.Rather than create a detriment to the public good, the proposed renewal and expansion of Gore Hall will result in public benefits in terms of expanding the University’s housing, improving the building’s accessibility and efficiency, and investing in the historic resources of Cambridge. This project in the context of the overall House Renewal program will allow Harvard to continue to house nearly all of its undergraduate students in a supportive environment, taking pressure off of the local housing market and providing a well-monitored student community. The project will dramatically improve the accessibility of the building for persons with disabilities including the introduction of new accessible entrances, elevators, and horizontal circulation throughout the building.  The project will use sustainable methods and materials with a goal of achieving LEED Gold certification. Through this project, Harvard is preserving several National Register buildings, which serve as a cornerstone of the iconic viewscape along the Charles River.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The Gore Hall renovation and expansion will not create any significant detriment to the River House area. The project calls for a continuation of the building’s dormitory use. The proposed project will result in no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide public benefits of improved accessibility, development of new housing facilities, historic preservation, and sustainable building means and methods. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will permit the preservation of the historic structures and allow the expansion of housing resources within Harvard’s campus.","The existing structure was built in a Residence 2 district and predates the later adoption of the Residence C-3 zoning district regulations in 1943 that called for front yard setbacks.   The current front yard setback formula in the Residence C-3 district is a function of the sum of the height of the building plus its length.  The proposed new building constitutes a significant structure on its own; however it will be treated as an addition to the original building from 1916, resulting in a combined building with a combined width of 329’. Though the addition’s maximum height of 70’ is well below the allowed maximum of 120’, the substantial length of the building is the determining factor in the large setback requirement of 77’ at Mill Street.  If the proposed addition were considered to be a building on its own, the required setback would only be 31’, which would render the current proposal nearly conforming. The existing building is a very large institutional structure, with characteristically large dimensions (232’ width).  Buildings of this scale and dimension located on such a large multi-acre lot are not generally characteristic of properties in the Residence C-3 zoning district.Gore Hall, 101 Plympton Street, and 111 Plympton Street are all considered contributing buildings in the Harvard Houses National Register District.  The University’s goal is to preserve these structures and their essential historic form and context while meeting the fundamental program of housing students and bringing these buildings into current code compliance and well-functioning operations.  The configuration of Gore Hall as well as the collective historic significance of the district are circumstances that do not generally affect this zoning district.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,01/22/2016

Due to the extremely narrow lot width (34’) compliant parking spaces and vehicular maneuvering clearances cannot be achieved without zoning relief. Petitioners’ had discussed a design option that didn’t require any zoning relief but that option was rejected by the direct abutter at 31 Kinnaird street as well as the Historical Commission which has approval over any demolition at the site.  Additionally the abutter at 31 Kinnaird street requested a great rear yard setback (30’+/-)than required by the Ordinance thereby siting the house within the front yard setback adding to the requested relief.,The requested addition has support from the neighbors and abutters most directly affected by development. Additionally the existing house is in poor condition and is need of significant repair. The rear yard currently contains five (5) parking spaces that will be converted into a landscaped rear yard area enhancing the privacy and reducing congestion on the lot.,Desirable relief may be granted without detriment to the public good nor derogating from the intent and purpose of the Ordinance because the zoning districts allows for two (2) units on the lot as of right and the requested relief will alleviate a congested rear yard area that contains numerous non-conforming parking spaces. Further the intent section of Ordinance 1.03 calls for the most rational use of land which in this unique circumstances is newly constructed and energy efficient  two family dwelling.,The Hardship is owing to the size and shape of the lot that is extremely narrow (34’) such that it is virtually impossible to meet the required 40’ parking and vehicular maneuvering dimensions (8.5’ parking space + 22’ rear back clearance) using the existing curb cut and driveway. Without relief Petitioners would not be able to construct a two family with compliant parking which is the only way they could afford to own a home in Cambridge.,With the requested relief the requirements of the ordinance will be satisfied.,"No congestion, hazard, or substantial change in the established neighborhood character will result from approval because the proposed driveway width and right yard setback are unchanged and the development will significantly reduce the number of vehicles parking on the lot. The property is sited in the Residence C-1 zoning district which allows for two family dwellings. Further there are many dwellings in the neighborhood with parking spaces that are similarly within 5’ of the side yard setback and have tandem parking spaces.",The continued operation of or the development of adjacent uses will not be adversely affected because the adjacent properties are predominately multifamily residential uses and the proposed renovation will be of a quality that is consistent with other newly constructed homes and restored properties that can be seen in the surrounding neighborhood.,"No nuisance or hazard will be created nor will any detriment to the health, safety and/or welfare of the of occupants of the proposed use or the citizens of the City because the proposed new construction will significantly upgrade this deteriorating dwelling into a vibrant two family dwelling adding to Cambridge’s housing stock and create an affordable home to the Petitioners that they could otherwise not afford.","The proposed parking layout will not impair the integrity of the district and is consistent with the intent of the ordinance by allowing for the rational use of land which will be achieved by allowing modest setback relief to park the vehicles within the 5' setback and significantly reducing the number of vehicles, congestion and automobile impact on adjacent lots.",Cambridge,MA,08/01/2016

Kelley Street as his primary residence and 7 RC Kelley Street as an investment property that was held in the 7 R.C. Kelley Street Realty Trust.

The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) (CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Maximum ratio of floor area to lot area)•	To exceed the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) permitted on the lot. The project calls for a small addition (335 SF) to create a code compliant egress path. The project overall will result in a reduction of FAR from 3.97 to 3.56, but will continue to exceed the 3.0 maximum for dwellings allowed in the Business B zoning district of the Harvard Square Overlay District.Variance 2: Alteration or Enlargement of a Nonconforming Structure and Use (CZO 8.22.3, not otherwise permitted by CZO 8.22.1 and 8.22.2)•	To permit the alteration or enlargement of a nonconforming structure not otherwise permitted by issuance of a building permit or special permit. Claverly is considered legally nonconforming for FAR and height.Harvard University is currently engaged in a system-wide effort to renew its undergraduate Houses.  The House system began in the 1930s as a cornerstone to the Harvard College education, creating an integrated living and learning community. Nearly all sophomores, juniors, and seniors live in one of twelve undergraduate Houses, including Adams House. Most of the buildings that comprise the current Adams House, including Claverly Hall (1893), were originally built in the late nineteenth century as private luxury dormitories in Harvard Square’s “Gold Coast.”  Later Claverly Hall and other buildings were purchased by the University and united to form Adams House. They are all considered contributing buildings in the Harvard Square National Register District.Harvard is planning the renewal of Adams House beginning with Claverly Hall in its first phase. The renewal has a goal to preserve the historic character and culture of the building while addressing code compliance, deferred maintenance, and raising it to contemporary House standards.  The project includes a small infill addition of an open-sided, notch-like lightwell in the rear of the building. The building’s lightwell faces an alley that contains a Harvard-owned surface parking lot and the back sides of several Harvard University buildings. The lightwell, approximately 11’ feet by 6’-8"" feet, is not visible from a public way and or any non-Harvard property. The addition comprises a 67 square feet of additional GFA on floors 2-5 as well as a covered exterior area on the ground level that also counts toward GFA for a total of 335 square feet of new GFA. The only existing interior egress path for residents who live in the southwest corner of the building is through the building’s central stair hallway. The proposed infill of the notch allows the creation of a new passageway for a code compliant egress path which does not coincide with the first egress path. Claverly Hall was built in 1892 prior to the 1924 adoption of the CZO and its provisions which govern the maximum allowable floor area and height permitted on a lot. The building is considered legally nonconforming with respect to FAR (allowable 3.0, existing 3.97) and height (allowable 60’, existing 60.5’). The proposed project calls for an alteration of a nonconforming building that proposes a small addition to a building with nonconforming FAR and thus requires zoning relief.A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would require that the building size remain unchanged and usable housing program space be compromised and reduced in order to incorporate the required code compliance modifications.  Meeting the specific dimensional and spatial requirements associated with the code mandated egress pathways fully within the building would result in the loss of approximately 1,400 square feet of space within the student living space, which is already significantly constrained. Given the City’s stated desire for institutions of higher education to provide housing for their students, such a loss of student bedrooms is contrary to that goal. Maintaining the structure in its current size would present a substantial hardship to the Harvard University as it would compromise Harvard’s ability to address life safety code compliance within an existing building and to meet the building code obligations.  The requested zoning relief will allow the Harvard to make required life safety improvements to Claverly Hall while maintaining the housing program. A literal enforcement of the zoning provisions would necessitate a more substantial renovation scope without any appreciable benefit to the program, safety or livability of the building. It would also entail the diminishment of the housing layout and capacity, which would diminish Harvard’s ability to house its students.","This project responds to the Cambridge Growth Policy 52, which states that “major educational institutions should be encouraged to provide housing” for their students through “effective use of existing land holdings” in the core campus.  Claverly Hall has been in University ownership and in use as a Harvard dormitory for nearly a century, since 1920. Rather than create a detriment to the public good, the proposed renewal of Claverly Hall will result in public benefits in terms of investing in the University’s stock of student housing, improving the building’s life safety and accessibility, and investing in the historic resources of Cambridge. The project will replace exterior fire escapes with an interior, code compliant secondary means of egress which will dramatically improve life safety for residents of the building. Modified entrances and new elevators will make the building accessible for persons with disabilities.  The project will use sustainable methods and materials including new exterior-wall insulation with a goal of achieving LEED Gold certification. Through this project, Harvard is preserving a National Register buildings within historic Harvard Square.","Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The proposed addition to Claverly Hall can be readily accommodated on the site in a manner that does not impact the overall physical character of the lot or the surrounding neighborhood. As noted above, the FAR will be reduced due to the project overall and the small addition is not visible from a public way and does not extend the building footprint.  The proposed project will result in no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide public benefits of improved accessibility and life safety, and sustainable building means and methods. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance will support the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will permit the preservation of the nonconforming historic structure, while significantly improving its life safety and accessibility.","Claverly Hall is organized around a main stair hall adjacent to the building’s front entry. This main stair is generally surrounded by student living suites consisting of bedrooms, common rooms, and private bathrooms. On every floor, the stair hall also connects to a hallway that runs along the north-south spine of the building, and a second egress stairway is located off of that hallway in the northern portion of the building. Currently residents living in the southwest corner of the building must pass through the main stair hall to access the second egress stairway. To provide an interior secondary means of egress that does not coincide with the main stair hall, as is required by building code, fire escapes had been previously installed on the building exterior. In the past such exterior fire escapes were acceptable by code but are no longer allowed.  To create a code compliant second means of egress to serve the spaces on the far side of the main stair, Harvard is proposing to create a new corridor connecting these suites to the north-south hallway. Wrapping this new corridor around the existing main stair hair in the most efficient way requires that the existing building notch be infilled.The building’s configuration of suites and bearing walls do not offer another viable path to connect the southwest student suites to this hallway without significant disruption to the layout. It would require the displacement of bathrooms, which would result in a loss of the number of bedrooms and the alteration of bearing walls. The proposed infill passageway would not only avoid the loss of bedrooms, it is also the most efficient route at ~44 feet long including the infill connector. If it were not possible to create an infill connector, the best alternative route to connect these southwest student suites with the hallway would need to wrap the long way around the stair hall, carving out space from six student suites, two on each of the top three floors. This route would take up 370 additional square feet per floor and would be approximately 74 feet long, about 1.7 times longer to serve the same function. On the two lower levels, this longer corridor would not be feasible be feasible due to the existence of a double-height coffered entry vestibule on the ground floor. On Floors G and 1, an alternative code compliant second egress path would require adding another stair, a third stair in the building, with direct access to the outside, which would involve additional structural work and new framing. This element, along with the internal corridor route described above, would displace approximately 1,400 SF of residential and support program, and would result in the loss of eight (8) to ten (10) student beds.Within the Harvard Square Overlay District, the Business B zoning district generally allows a maximum FAR of 4.0, except in cases where the structure contains dwellings, which is the case with Claverly.  If Claverly Hall supported any other allowed use besides dwellings, then the building’s existing and proposed FAR would be considered conforming as it is below 4.0, and the project would not require zoning relief.",,,,,,Cambridge,MA,09/12/2018

In reliance on those approvals (which ISD now says it issued in error), Verizon invested approximately $2 million in building out and equipping the space.  Without a variance, Verizon will be required to close down the operations, resulting in substantial hardship.In addition to the financial hardship associated with the potential closure of the Alley space, literal enforcement of the office use prohibition on this facility would create a substantial hardship to Verizon’s incubation of new technology.  Verizon did not enter into this venture with the expectation that it would be a major revenue generator.  Verizon is not a real estate company, but rather a telecommunications and technology company, whose primary interest in the Alley powered by Verizon space is being at the vanguard of telecommunications technology incubation.  This facility in this location allows Verizon to collaborate with local startups and entrepreneurs to develop technology for the future.  Indeed, Verizon chose to locate an Alley powered by Verizon in this location because of the close proximity of world class academic institutions, a progressive, tech-forward culture and the City’s expressed desire to be innovative.  Worldwide, Verizon only operates similar co-work space in four other cutting-edge cities (New York, Washington, London and Singapore).  The existing Verizon telecommunications center at 10 Ware Street makes this the only location in Cambridge where this technology collaboration can occur.  A denial of the requested use variance will result in a hardship both to Verizon as it seeks to leverage the resources of Cambridge to drive technology innovation, and to the many members of the Cambridge business and technology community who have availed themselves of this unique opportunity.","a.	Substantial detriment to the public good for the following reasons:The Alley coworking space at the Building operates harmoniously with the surrounding residential neighborhood.  It is entirely self-contained and open only to those with Alley memberships, which means only a pre-screened and controlled number of visitors enter and exit the premises.  No noise is generated by the use.  (Verizon notes that some neighbors have brought to its attention concerns over noise during recent construction; such construction was related solely to the permitted telecommunications use at the Property and had nothing to do with the coworking use.)  The coworking use also has no traffic or parking impacts on the neighborhood.  No on-site parking is provided for visitors to Alley and the surrounding streets are permit parking-only, which means that visitors are not reducing the supply of parking spaces on neighborhood streets.   Since it opened in 2017, Alley has tracked the transportation patterns of its members; nearly all access the Property by public transportation, walking, or bicycle.  To that end, Verizon has sponsored a Blue Bikes installation immediately in front of the Property.  There is also a free bike rack for Alley visitors and Cambridge residents to use. The Alley powered by Verizon is, in fact, beneficial to the community.  The space hosts events, programs and workshops to promote and engage local startups, academics, and business associations.  Alley is also committed to supporting the local economy beyond the tech community:  the food and beverage services provided to its members draw exclusively from local vendors.  Moreover, Alley offers discounted memberships to all residential neighbors within a 2-block radius of the Property.   Since its opening, Alley has seamlessly integrated into the local community.  Requiring Verizon to shutter these operations would be detrimental to the neighborhood, the Harvard Square community, and the City of Cambridge.","Alley’s successful integration into the community evidences that, consistent with the goals articulated in Section 1.3 of the Ordinance, coworking space is a rational use of the Property that encourages appropriate economic development, while being entirely compatible with the surrounding residential area.  Intensification of the permitted telecommunications use – which is Verizon’s only option for this space if Alley is not permitted to continue – will likely present greater impacts to its surroundings.  As such, granting relief for the Alley space will not nullify nor substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  In granting relief for the Alley space, Cambridge will enable Verizon to adapt an early 20th century technology building to the 21st century.",The Building has served as a telecommunications center since it was constructed in the early 1930s.  The equipment housed in the Building serves most of Cambridge and a portion of Somerville.  Verizon opened the Alley space to serve as an incubator for the new technologies it is bringing on line at the Building; the Alley space and the telecommunications equipment at the Building are inextricably linked.  The permanent installation of extensive telecommunications equipment and infrastructure at this location is unique to the Property and hinders Verizon’s ability to locate the Alley operations anywhere else in Cambridge.  Denial of the requested relief will create a hardship in that it will require extensive soil excavation in order to remove the cables and equipment that currently service Alley members. The Property is also the only telecommunications center located in the C-1 Zoning District; Verizon and its uses are truly sui generis in the zoning district and the foregoing considerations do not affect generally the zoning district overall.,,,,,,Boston,MA,10/31/2018

Construction costs will be substantial, and the owner seeks to make several improvements that will be necessary to insure the structural soundness of the project. Due to the currently non-conforming nature of the structure, specifically its size (which exceeds current allowable Floor Area Ratio and side and rear setbacks for the Residence B district), these very modest changes will result in minimal modifications to a non-conforming structure that increase the current non-conformity. Under a recent Supreme Judicial Court decision, Maria Bellalta & another vs. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline & others, SJC-12516, Slip Opinion dated February 8, 2019, such de minimus alterations to a pre-existing non-conforming two-family structure such as this one should be allowed to proceed with a finding of this Board under G.L. c. 40A, Section 6, upon a finding of “no substantial detriment” – in essence, a special permit standard. (See a copy of the Slip Opinion for Bellalta v. ZBA Brookline, included in this BZA application).  The Petitioner has been advised by the Commissioner of Inspectional Services that this Board may not hear this case on such basis unless and until the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance has been amended to reflect the import of the Bellalta decision.  Thus, the Petitioner hereby requests the Board find that the modest alterations requested in this application be allowed as a variance under Article 5, Section 5.3000, since a literal enforcement of the ordinance would impose substantial hardship, both financial and otherwise, prohibiting the Petitioner from making necessary and desirable improvements to this two-family home. The following alterations result in an increase in Floor Area requiring a variance: a) reconstructing (on a flat plane) he front wall of the home to remove bay feature that has resulted in water infiltration and drainage issues; b) expanding attic level dormer to allow for sufficient head space to create livable space in the currently unusable attic; and c) rebuilding the roof to the rear second-floor porch that was destroyed after storm and wood rot damage resulted in the roof failing and being demolished for safety reasons","The relief from Dimensional Standards of Section 5.31 may be granted without any detriment to the public good, because the changes are very minimal – a small increase in Floor Area, occurring within the existing footprint of the structure.  The expanded dormer (from 12.5 ft. to 15 ft.) which is set back from the street in compliance with dimensional standards, will not negatively impact the neighbors on that side.  The change to the front wall of the house will not further encroach, and increased square footage will have no adverse impacts for abutters. Replacing the rear porch roof will not negatively impact neighbors as this was a condition that had been in place for decades prior to its recent demolition. There will be no impacts to the District in terms of street congestion or adequate parking on account of the relief requested herein.  In allowing this zoning relief, the Board will allow for the Petitioner to proceed with plans to undertake a significant renovation to an historic two-family home that might otherwise be demolished by a less industrious, less-historically-minded owner.  As such, a grant of variance relief will allow for the rehabilitation of a historic, two-family home and restoration of the existing housing stock that will be desirable for future residents.","Consistent with the stated intent and purpose of the ordinance, as detailed in Section 1.30 of Article 1.000 Preamble of the Zoning ordinance as well as M.G.L Ch. 40A Zoning Section 10 Variances, the proposed project will:•	Create quality housing with valued open space for the benefit of the Petitioner, abutters, and successor owners.•	Not result in use or activity not otherwise permitted in the ordinance.•	Not result in negative impacts listed in the Section 1.3 regarding traffic, population density, blight and pollution.","The hardships described herein are owing to the unique circumstances relating to the interior layout of the structure, the siting of the structure on this undersized, narrow lot, and on account of storm and structural failure which lead to loss of the rear second-floor porch roof prior to the Petitioner’s purchase of the home.  The modest (14 square feet) increase in Floor Area are the result of alterations that are necessary for construction/structural reasons (to rebuild a porch roof after storm and structural failure) or to allow for additional much-needed, living space for future inhabitants.",,,,,,Boston,MA,06/28/2019

New construction is one wood framed structure integrating a two car garage. All nonconformities are eliminated and new construction is zoning compliant. Relief is only sought to increase safety, decrease energy use, and to improve design and functionality.",A literal enforcement of the Ordinance decreases both the safety of the basement egress and the likelihood of achieving the Net Zero Energy goal.,There is limited impact on neighboring properties as the side boundaries are 120’ long. Most relief is on the North with one railing being about 4’ long and the two being about 7’ long. The railings are 3 feet into the (conforming) setback but will be screened from abutter(s) by replacing the chain link fence with a wood fence higher than the railings.,"This relief does not derogate the intent of the Ordinance as it intends to promote safety and sustainability. In fact, Article 22 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance is devoted to Sustainability. Moreover, the City Council adopted the Net Zero Action Plan in 2015. It requires Net Zero for small residential construction in 2022, 18 months away. Additionally, Ordinance Sections 5.24.1 and 5.24.2 allow very similar structures in setbacks.","The by-right design is identical except basement egress is more difficult. People either climb the stairs and exit from the floor above or climb into the window well and lift up the grate (maybe a problem when there is ice, corrosion, or a blockage, or for a small child or elderly person). With relief, in a fire, people may exit the door or window without lifting a grate. Another hardship is that Eversource limits by the assessor’s lot the amount of energy that can be sent to the electric grid. This is based on the lot, not on the use or size of structures. This limits the amount of solar energy generated. This limit forces the most efficient structures. They must be the smallest, the lowest, and positioned to best use the sun. To use the window well grate, the by-right design requires inefficient double-hung windows instead of casements.",Section 6.44.1 (g) allows a driveway in the proposed location upon the issuance of a Special Permit.,The driveway has been in basically the same location for decades. There will still be a two car garage. Little change in the traffic pattern can be expected by moving the driveway about three feet south.,Moving the driveway three feet southerly and deeper into the five foot driveway setback will have no effect on the operation or development of the adjacent (residential) uses. Additionally a six foot wood fence is proposed to replace the existing mixture of four foot high chain link and six foot wood stockade fencing along the driveway with the consent of the neighbor.,The driveway will not conflict with either the house on the left (its driveway is on Dudley St) or the house on the right (its driveway is about 50’ away). Conflict decreases with the driveway across Jackson St as the driveways move further apart.,The new driveway is less than half the area of the old driveway and will be permeable pavers. This will reduce the effects of storm water for the neighborhood.,Cambridge,MA,08/14/2019

Adding a project identification sign and directional signage to the parking facility allows tenants and the Owner to improve awareness of the project’s offering, increase business and maintain rents.",Approval of the proposed designs will not have a negative visual impact on the neighborhood. The proposed signage is only a modest increase from the Ordinance.

One Kendall Square is a commercial and lifestyle resource in Cambridge.  The continued vitality of the project, the quality of tenants and the ongoing upgrades to project facilities promote that goal.  The signage design included in this proposal helps to maintain the viability and commercial impact of the project on the City of Cambridge.","One Kendall Square is a unique mixed-use project in Cambridge with 12 restaurants, a cinema, dozens of office tenants and a remote parking facility.  The urban core characteristics of the site: intense pedestrian and bicycle traffic, limited parking and limited street front exposure for tenants requires a strong common identity and directional signage for key elements such as parking.  The use of the tower as an iconic location for project identity signage supports a common identity which allows for a lower key standard for retail tenant identity.  The parking directional blade sign improves traffic circulation and provides an essential message to visitors that parking is available.",,,,,,Santa Rosa,CA,04/06/2016

Except for reconfiguration of the back porch and stairs, of wood, and construction of an exterior window well, of concrete, on the right side of the building, all construction will consist of internal buildout of a basement apartment.","The basement has high ceilings and therefore counts as floor area, but to convert it to habitable space by joining it with first floor apartment would be very difficult and impractical due to structural limitations imposed by the stair locations and configuration.  A separate dwelling unit in basement would help to overcome the structural limitations upon suitable  use of floor area for occupancy.","All improvements would be internal, and other than insertion of a window well for second egress and re-orientation of the back porch and stairs the building exterior envelope would not be changed at all.  The total number of persons occupying the building would not vary from the number that would be permissible if the basement space were integrated with the first floor.  The open space per dwelling unit would only slightly change with a 5th unit added.  4 parking spaces to be supplied, combined with public transportation close nearby would avoid any adverse effects upon parking or traffic in the neighborhood.","A majority of the building is located in a Commercial zone.  While Residence B regulations apply because a portion of the lot is in the Residence B district, the conversion of basement space to a 5th unit in this prior nonconforming building would not change the footprint of the building or adversely affect the residential use of the immediately abutting multifamily building on Spruce Street.  No overcrowding would occur and the ratio of parking spaces to number of dwelling units would actually increase.",The peculiar location and layout of stairs in the building and limited access between other floors and the basement makes it difficult and impractical to integrate the available living space in the basement with any other apartment in the building.,"The number of parking spaces to be provided will double, so that the ratio of parking spaces to the number of dwelling units will actually increase.  Fencing and screening will be provided between the parking spaces and the setback from the abutting premises to the rear.","The number of parking spaces to be added will alleviate parking needs in the neighborhood by adding two spaces while only adding one dwelling unit.  In addition, the availability of two bus lines within a block from locus makes the provision of 4 off street spaces for the 5 dwelling units in the building more than adequate. The parking will be located  in such a manner that will avoid any adverse impact on traffic on Cushing or Spruce Street.",The abutters' concerns about traffic and parking have been fully  addressed and satisfied.  No overcrowding of the neighborhood by the insertion of a small dwelling unit in the basement will occur. The immediately abutting lot on Spruce contains a large nonconforming three family building which effects a smooth transition between the locus and other residences located on Spruce Street. Fencing and green screening to protect views from the yard of the immediately abutting condominium on Spruce Street will be provided.,"Traffic and parking will not be adversely affected at all, given that ratio of parking spaces to number of dwelling units will actually be increased.","Addition of a 5th dwelling unit wholly within this prior nonconforming building most of which is located within a commercial district will not adversely affect the residential character of the lots located to the rear of the locus in this residence B district, and the locus is well buffered from the rest of the neighborhood by its location next to commercial uses and to a large multifamily building that immediately abuts it.","Boston, MA",MA,02/10/2021
