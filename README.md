# Datathon

Harvard Open Data Project's 2021 Datathon on affordable housing in Cambridge, MA. bhatt_garg_hodpdatathon.pdf is the final presentation.

We mainly analyzed the effects of high density housing and zoning regulations. 

Warning: these files are incredibly, incredibly messy - this was a 12 hour datathon and we were rushing to put 
together the analysis, so apoligies for messy files and lack of comments.
